"Bitcoin premium on Binance.US is symptom of illiquid market: Kaiko","Kaiko data showed that Bitcoin was trading at a 2.5% premium on Binance.US compared to other U.S.-based exchanges.","Bitcoin (BTC) premium trades on Binance.US is a symptom of an illiquid market and not evidence of market makers exiting the platform, according to blockchain analytical firm Kaiko.

In its May 9 report, the data aggregator explained why the flagship digital asset traded at a 2.5% premium on Binance.US compared to other U.S.-based exchanges.

Source: Kaiko

According to the firm, speculations that market makers might be exiting the platform were mere rumors as there are no changes in its market depth.

Since April, several crypto community members have highlighted the increasing premium BTC trade on the platform — with many inferring that market makers and insiders might be leaving because of possible legal action.

However, Kaiko rejected such assertions noting that the exchange’s struggle for a banking partner could play a role in the trades.

Kaiko said:

“The premium on Binance.US is more likely related to the exchange’s struggles to find a banking partner since the closure of Signature and Silvergate. With a surging demand for BTC generally, investors on Binance.US are likely looking at quicker withdrawal times for BTC compared to USD, and are rushing to trade into BTC at the same time, resulting in a premium on the exchange.”

Source: Kaiko

Compared to the global Binance exchange, whose BTC’s 1% market depth has alternated between several highs and lows, Binance.US’s depth has remained stable. Kaiko data noted that this would not be so if a major market maker had left the platform.

Following the U.S. banking crisis that claimed three major crypto-friendly banks in March, the crypto industry has been exposed to low liquidity risks. At the time, CryptoSlate Insight reported that BTC’s order book reached a 10-month low.

Another report noted that U.S.-based exchanges and market makers became less liquid as they seem most affected by Silvergate’s implosion.

"Grayscale establishes funds trust, files for three new crypto funds","Those funds involve Bitcoin ETPs, Ethereum futures, and to a lesser extent, Zcash.","Grayscale Investments announced on May 9 that it has formed a new entity called Grayscale Funds Trust and filed for three new crypto investment funds.

Grayscale proposes three new ETFs

The Grayscale Funds Trust will act as a Delaware statutory trust structure that allows the firm to manage its older products while also pursuing exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

In addition to creating that new trust, Grayscale has filed registration statements for three new ETFs that are directly or indirectly related to cryptocurrency.

The first is the Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF, which will derive value from exposure to Ethereum futures contracts. The second is the Grayscale Privacy ETF; this fund will track the Indxx Privacy Index, which itself includes Grayscale’s Zcash Trust.

The third fund is the Grayscale Global Bitcoin Composite ETF, which will make use of exchange-traded products and investment vehicles as well as securities from Bitcoin mining companies. The fund will not invest in digital assets directly, the filing says.

Grayscale emphasized that though it has filed regulatory applications, the above funds are not yet effective and cannot be bought or sold before they become effective.

Grayscale continues to pursue spot ETF

Grayscale is one of the most notable investment firms offering crypto investment vehicles for institutions. The company’s Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has a market cap of $10.84 billion, and the firm also offers numerous other cryptocurrency trusts.

However, GBTC redemptions were halted in 2014 following conflicts with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). GBTC has recently traded at a discount.

Grayscale has also had difficulty obtaining permission from the SEC that would allow it to convert GBTC into a spot ETF. Grayscale has gone to court over the matter but has not succeeded in launching a crypto spot ETF despite its efforts.

No other firm has successfully launched a Bitcoin spot ETF to date.

"Biden calls for end to tax loopholes that benefit ‘wealthy crypto investors’","The President cast those opposed to his tax plan as ""MAGA Republicans.""","U.S. President Joe Biden called for an end to unspecified crypto tax rules on May 9.

On Twitter, Biden posted an infographic that read: “We think Congress should cut tax loopholes that help wealthy crypto investors.”

Such cuts would supposedly save $18 billion, according to the infographic. However, Biden did not specifically state which tax loopholes existed where reforms would produce those savings.

Early accounts of Biden’s tax plan, first advanced in March, suggested that the government could raise $24 billion through crypto tax rules focused on wash trading.

The Biden administration also proposed a 30% tax on crypto mining, which was advanced again on May 2. However, it is unclear how much funding this tax might generate, and this rule is seemingly aimed at mining firms rather than investors.

Biden also cast those opposed to his plans as supporters of the Republican party, writing: “We don’t have to guess what MAGA House Republicans value. They’re telling us.”

Biden’s infographic also said that Republicans want Congress to cut food safety inspection to save $15 billion, likely in reference to proposals advanced around April 26.

"DCG is ‘in discussions’ with capital providers amidst Genesis mediation","The company expressed support for creditors who are in mediation with Genesis.","Digital Currency Group (DCG) provided an update on the status of its subsidiary, Genesis Capital, in a statement on May 9.

DCG said that it remains “engaged with the various stakeholders” who are involved in a mediation process concerning Genesis’ restructuring process. The company said it aims to reach a “productive resolution” and “fair outcome for all.”

DCG additionally said that it is “in discussions” with capital providers to obtain growth capital and to refinance outstanding obligations with Genesis.

Several of Genesis’ creditors walked away from a past agreement around April 25, objecting to details of DCG’s contributions to Genesis’ restructuring plan. Genesis agreed to enter mediation with several of its creditors during the last week of April. DCG said today that all parties officially entered the mediation process on May 1.

Genesis first filed for bankruptcy on Jan. 19 and owed at least $3.5 billion to its creditors at that time. The bankruptcy only extends to its lending division.

"Marathon, Zero Two to launch sustainable mining operation in Abu Dhabi","The operation will have a total energy capacity of 250 MW and a hashrate of 7 EH/s.","Marathon Digital Holdings and Zero Two announced a new Middle Eastern mining operation in a press release on May 9.

The first mining site as part of the operation will be in Abu Dhabi’s Masdar City. It will have an energy capacity of 200 megawatts (MW).

The second mining site will be located in Mina Zayed — Abu Dhabi’s port area — with an energy capacity of 50 megawatts (MW).

Both sites should be active by the end of 2023 with 7 EH/s of hashrate.

Sustainable energy

Marathon and Zero Two said that the operation would use Abu Dhabi’s excess energy and improve the sustainability of the city’s energy grid. The companies will also purchase clean energy certificates to offset any non-sustainable energy use.

The companies said they ran a pilot program to test the possibility of immersion mining in Abu Dhabi. Immersion mining — which involves submerging mining devices in a liquid coolant — is difficult in hot climates. However, two companies were able to create their own immersion solution and found this approach to be feasible.

The mining operation is expected to receive $406 million in capital investment. Marathon and Zero Two said that they have already ordered equipment and infrastructure.

A joint venture

To proceed with the project, Marathon and Zero Two have established a new entity called Abu Dhabi Global Markets JV Entity, which will operate the two crypto-mining sites. Zero Two will own 80% of the entity’s equity, while Marathon will own 20% of the entity’s equity.

Marathon is among the most notable U.S.-based crypto mining companies. It reported mining 702 BTC ($20 million) in April and said that it operated 122,900 devices in total.

Little is known about Zero Two, apart from the fact that it is a blockchain infrastructure development company in Abu Dhabi and is also registered as FS Innovation.

"Limewire has raised over $16M for its blockchain-focused revival","The project's LWMR token will be listed on top exchanges in the coming days.","Limewire said May 9 that it raised more than $16 million for its revived platform through sales of its cryptocurrency token (LMWR).

Limewire surpasses $15M goal

By raising $16.5 million, Limewire has surpassed its $15 million funding goal and is more than halfway to its $30 million fundraising limit.

The project’s website says that the sale will close on May 11 and that the token will be listed on four major exchanges beginning on May 16.

The project raised funds in fiat as well as cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC) USD Coin (USDC), Tether (USD), and Binance Coin (BNB). It added support for XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC) payments around May 6.

Limewire previously announced on April 21 that it had raised $10 million through a private sale led by led by Kraken Ventures, Arrington Capital, and GSR.

NFT platform for creators

Limewire is best known as a file-sharing service active in the early 2000s. The platform became controversial for enabling copyright infringement of music and faced lawsuits from the recording industry. Limewire was eventually shut down circa 2010.

However, Limewire’s revived version will instead serve as a platform for music artists. Creators will be able to create content on blockchain-based content and monetize that content with cryptocurrency rewards, payments, and subscriptions.

Content on the platform will be stored and traded as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and access to that content can be gated behind NFTs and other tokens.

"Coinbase ex-manager gets 2-year sentence for insider trading","Coinbase's former product manager, Ishan Wahi got sentenced to two years in prison by the US authorities.","The U.S. authorities sentenced Coinbase‘s former Product Manager to two years in jail for insider trading, according to Reuters.

On May 9, 2023, the prosecutors decided Ishan Wahi’s sentence for participating in a scheme that involved “massive abuse” of Coinbase’s trust, the Reuters article noted.

Background of the case

In January, Ishan Wahi’s brother Nikhil Wahi got sentenced to 10 months in prison for the same reason – making trades based on confidential Coinbase information. At the time, Nikhil Wahi admitted that it was his brother Ishan Wahi who leaked the information to him and his friend, Sameer Ramani.

Based on the information Ishan Wahi leaked, Ramani and Nikhil Wahi used anonymous wallets and made over $1 million on trades between July 2021 and May 2022. Ishan Wahi was arrested together with his brother, Nikhil Wahi, in January. However, Ishan Wahi pleaded not guilty, while Ramani was outside the U.S. borders.

In February, Ishan Wahi filed a lawsuit and asked the U.S. authorities to dismiss the charges against him. Wahi claimed the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lacked legal authority to classify tokens as securities. Wahi’s lawyers contended that the assets and asset holders involved in the case were not a part of any “common enterprise” since tokens are not considered an investment contract. Therefore, the insider trading charges were inapplicable.

The court decision

According to Reuters, Wahi said he “made a huge mistake” that will follow him for the rest of his life. Assistant U.S. Attorney Noah Solowiejczyk responded by stating that this was not a simple “one-off mistake” but a stream of tips scattered over ten months.

Wahi asked the court for a sentence that was no longer his brother’s. During his brother Nikhil Wahi’s hearing, the prosecutors recommended Nikhil Wahi be sentenced to prison for at least ten months. Nikhil Wahi’s defense lawyers managed to settle for the least by claiming that 26-year-old Wahi’s primary motivation was to repay his college debt, and he hadn’t been arrested before.

In the case of Ishan Wahi, the prosecutors recommended he spend more than three years in jail. Ishan Wahi noted that other crypto-related insider trading cases usually resulted in little or no prison time. However, the court sentenced him to two years in prison for the civil counterpart of using deception to seek financial gain.

"PayPal customers increase crypto deposits to $943M","PayPal's latest Form 10-Q filing shows crypto deposits are up 56% - but how much relates to fresh deposits versus dollar value increases?","PayPal disclosed it holds $943 million in customers’ crypto assets, up 56% from the previous quarter.

The company enables users in some regions to buy, hold, sell, and pay for purchases using cryptocurrency. However, PayPal doesn’t have any cryptocurrencies on its balance sheet other than those belonging to its customers.

PayPal customers up their deposits

In its latest Q1 2023 Form 10-Q SEC filing, the online payments firm revealed that customers’ crypto deposits jumped from $604 million in the prior quarter to $943 million as of March 31.

The table below shows Bitcoin was the most popular in terms of current holdings and quarter-over-quarter percentage increase – spiking 71% to just short of half a billion dollars.

The pattern repeated, with the second-most held cryptocurrency, Ethereum seeing a 45% increase in deposits. While “Other,” consisting of Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin, saw gains of plus 30%.

Source: investor.pypl.com

PayPal stated that the risks of accounting for cryptocurrency, including “technological, legal, and regulatory risks,” meant crypto assets are recorded as both a liability and an asset on their books.

Hodl

Last year was a tumultuous one for cryptocurrency, characterized by CeFi bankruptcies, particularly the FTX scandal.

Nonetheless, by the first quarter of 2023, the total crypto market cap saw a significant increase of 49%, rising from $796 billion on December 31st, 2022, to $1,183 billion on March 31st, 2023 – suggesting the market has recovered to a degree.

Without a detailed breakdown of PayPal customers’ holdings, it is unclear precisely how much of the 56% quarter-over-quarter increase in deposits relates to increased crypto holdings or the increase in dollar value over that period.

However, using the crude measure of a 49% increase in total market cap between quarters, it is probable that the majority of the increase relates to an increase in the dollar value of holdings – rather than a jump in customers’ deposits.

"Binance’s NFT marketplace to support Bitcoin Ordinals","The total number of Bitcoin NFTs spiked above 5 million earlier today after a recent surge in activity, according to Dune analytics data.","Crypto exchange Binance said its marketplace would enable support for Bitcoin (BTC) Ordinals.

In a May 8 statement, Binance said it was enabling support for Bitcoin NFTs to elevate its marketplace to a multi-chain, open marketplace ecosystem, where users can explore and trade a variety of NFTs across multiple blockchains from their accounts.

“Binance NFT believes Bitcoin’s innovative technology and cultural significance represent an exciting new horizon, offering unique opportunities for NFT creation.”

The support would enable the exchange users to trade these NFTs directly from their accounts while enjoying its platform’s security and stability.

Binance said it would offer Bitcoin NFT creators royalties when their assets are bought and sold on its platform.

Bitcoin Ordinal Inscriptions cross 5 million

The number of Bitcoin NFTs spiked above 5 million after a recent surge in activity mainly consisting of text-based assets, data from Dune analytics show.

CryptoSlate Insight reported that these Inscriptions had generated a cumulative fee of 904 Bitcoin, benefiting BTC miners. As of press time, this has risen to 1,019 BTC ($27.64 million), according to Dune analytics data.

Source: Dune Analytics

The increase has followed the introduction of the Bitcoin Request for Comment (BRC-20) token standard, which allows users to transferable assets directly through the blockchain network.

In the last 24 hours, there were 241,880 unique inscriptions on Bitcoin, of which 193,349 were text-based. There were less than 500 inscriptions of images, applications, and tokens during the period.

According to the brc-20.io website, BRC-20 tokens have a total market cap of over $1 billion — with the top token being Ordi, valued at $471.47 million.

Meanwhile, the BRC-20 tokens have a cumulative volume of over $207 million during the last 24 hours.

The current BTC NFTs drive has pushed the average network fees to $30.91 — a level not seen since April 2021.

"Microsoft, Goldman, others partner for privacy-enabled blockchain Canton Network","Canton Network would launch in July when the network participants would test its interoperability capabilities.","Digital Asset, alongside several traditional financial firms and technology giants, are partnering to launch Canton Network — a privacy-enabled blockchain network designed for institutional assets.

According to a May 9 press statement, the new network would be launched in July when the network participants  — which include the likes of Goldman Sachs, Cumberland, S&P Global, SBI Digital Asset Holdings, Umbrage, Microsoft, Paxos, Deloitte, CBOE, and others —  would test its interoperability capabilities across a range of applications and use cases.

With Canton Network’s design, traditional financial institutions can offer users new innovative products and experience a safer and reconciliation-free environment where assets, data, and cash can synchronize freely across applications.

“[Canton Network] creates a ‘network of networks’, allowing previously siloed systems in financial markets to interoperate with the appropriate governance, privacy, permissioning and controls required for highly regulated industries.”

A Deloitte Consulting principal, Joseph Cody, said the blockchain network is the first of its kind, adding that the Canton Network can help with the “tokenization of assets, facilitating rapid cross-organizational settlement, creating new marketplaces, and establishing an immutable record of shared data, and facilitating secure transactions.”

Canton is built on Digital Asset’s smart contract language, Daml.

How Canton Network differs from rival blockchains

Canton Network says it combines the smart contract capabilities of blockchain networks like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) with privacy features similar to those on Bitcoin Lightning and ZCash (ZEC).

According to its white paper, this helps to differentiate it from other blockchain networks, which are limited in their operations. Some of these networks’ limitations include their layer1 strict, vertical limits on transaction capacity. Another challenge of these networks was that asset issuers had to forfeit control of that asset to a pool of pseudonymous validators.

“From a regulatory perspective, the data transparency and loss of control over assets make these networks unsuitable for use by financial institutions.”

Canton Network says it helps solve these limitations by enabling applications across multiple subnets to natively interoperate without requiring a layer 2 protocol or asset bridge.

“As of early 2023, financial institutions transact over $50 billion daily on limited-access subnets of the Canton Network.”

With a surging demand for BTC generally, investors on Binance.US are likely looking at quicker withdrawal times for BTC compared to USD, and are rushing to trade into BTC at the same time, resulting in a premium on the exchange.”

Source: Kaiko

Compared to the global Binance exchange, whose BTC’s 1% market depth has alternated between several highs and lows, Binance.US’s depth has remained stable. Kaiko data noted that this would not be so if a major market maker had left the platform.

Following the U.S. banking crisis that claimed three major crypto-friendly banks in March, the crypto industry has been exposed to low liquidity risks. At the time, CryptoSlate Insight reported that BTC’s order book reached a 10-month low.

Another report noted that U.S.-based exchanges and market makers became less liquid as they seem most affected by Silvergate’s implosion.

"Grayscale establishes funds trust, files for three new crypto funds","Those funds involve Bitcoin ETPs, Ethereum futures, and to a lesser extent, Zcash.","Grayscale Investments announced on May 9 that it has formed a new entity called Grayscale Funds Trust and filed for three new crypto investment funds.

Grayscale proposes three new ETFs

The Grayscale Funds Trust will act as a Delaware statutory trust structure that allows the firm to manage its older products while also pursuing exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

In addition to creating that new trust, Grayscale has filed registration statements for three new ETFs that are directly or indirectly related to cryptocurrency.

The first is the Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF, which will derive value from exposure to Ethereum futures contracts. The second is the Grayscale Privacy ETF; this fund will track the Indxx Privacy Index, which itself includes Grayscale’s Zcash Trust.

The third fund is the Grayscale Global Bitcoin Composite ETF, which will make use of exchange-traded products and investment vehicles as well as securities from Bitcoin mining companies. The fund will not invest in digital assets directly, the filing says.

Grayscale emphasized that though it has filed regulatory applications, the above funds are not yet effective and cannot be bought or sold before they become effective.

Grayscale continues to pursue spot ETF

Grayscale is one of the most notable investment firms offering crypto investment vehicles for institutions. The company’s Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has a market cap of $10.84 billion, and the firm also offers numerous other cryptocurrency trusts.

However, GBTC redemptions were halted in 2014 following conflicts with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). GBTC has recently traded at a discount.

Grayscale has also had difficulty obtaining permission from the SEC that would allow it to convert GBTC into a spot ETF. Grayscale has gone to court over the matter but has not succeeded in launching a crypto spot ETF despite its efforts.

No other firm has successfully launched a Bitcoin spot ETF to date.

"Biden calls for end to tax loopholes that benefit ‘wealthy crypto investors’","The President cast those opposed to his tax plan as ""MAGA Republicans.""","U.S. President Joe Biden called for an end to unspecified crypto tax rules on May 9.

On Twitter, Biden posted an infographic that read: “We think Congress should cut tax loopholes that help wealthy crypto investors.”

Such cuts would supposedly save $18 billion, according to the infographic. However, Biden did not specifically state which tax loopholes existed where reforms would produce those savings.

Early accounts of Biden’s tax plan, first advanced in March, suggested that the government could raise $24 billion through crypto tax rules focused on wash trading.

The Biden administration also proposed a 30% tax on crypto mining, which was advanced again on May 2. However, it is unclear how much funding this tax might generate, and this rule is seemingly aimed at mining firms rather than investors.

Biden also cast those opposed to his plans as supporters of the Republican party, writing: “We don’t have to guess what MAGA House Republicans value. They’re telling us.”

Biden’s infographic also said that Republicans want Congress to cut food safety inspection to save $15 billion, likely in reference to proposals advanced around April 26.

"DCG is ‘in discussions’ with capital providers amidst Genesis mediation","The company expressed support for creditors who are in mediation with Genesis.","Digital Currency Group (DCG) provided an update on the status of its subsidiary, Genesis Capital, in a statement on May 9.

DCG said that it remains “engaged with the various stakeholders” who are involved in a mediation process concerning Genesis’ restructuring process. The company said it aims to reach a “productive resolution” and “fair outcome for all.”

DCG additionally said that it is “in discussions” with capital providers to obtain growth capital and to refinance outstanding obligations with Genesis.

Several of Genesis’ creditors walked away from a past agreement around April 25, objecting to details of DCG’s contributions to Genesis’ restructuring plan. Genesis agreed to enter mediation with several of its creditors during the last week of April. DCG said today that all parties officially entered the mediation process on May 1.

Genesis first filed for bankruptcy on Jan. 19 and owed at least $3.5 billion to its creditors at that time. The bankruptcy only extends to its lending division.

"Marathon, Zero Two to launch sustainable mining operation in Abu Dhabi","The operation will have a total energy capacity of 250 MW and a hashrate of 7 EH/s.","Marathon Digital Holdings and Zero Two announced a new Middle Eastern mining operation in a press release on May 9.

The first mining site as part of the operation will be in Abu Dhabi’s Masdar City. It will have an energy capacity of 200 megawatts (MW).

The second mining site will be located in Mina Zayed — Abu Dhabi’s port area — with an energy capacity of 50 megawatts (MW).

Both sites should be active by the end of 2023 with 7 EH/s of hashrate.

Sustainable energy

Marathon and Zero Two said that the operation would use Abu Dhabi’s excess energy and improve the sustainability of the city’s energy grid. The companies will also purchase clean energy certificates to offset any non-sustainable energy use.

The companies said they ran a pilot program to test the possibility of immersion mining in Abu Dhabi. Immersion mining — which involves submerging mining devices in a liquid coolant — is difficult in hot climates. However, two companies were able to create their own immersion solution and found this approach to be feasible.

The mining operation is expected to receive $406 million in capital investment. Marathon and Zero Two said that they have already ordered equipment and infrastructure.

A joint venture

To proceed with the project, Marathon and Zero Two have established a new entity called Abu Dhabi Global Markets JV Entity, which will operate the two crypto-mining sites. Zero Two will own 80% of the entity’s equity, while Marathon will own 20% of the entity’s equity.

Marathon is among the most notable U.S.-based crypto mining companies. It reported mining 702 BTC ($20 million) in April and said that it operated 122,900 devices in total.

Little is known about Zero Two, apart from the fact that it is a blockchain infrastructure development company in Abu Dhabi and is also registered as FS Innovation.

"Limewire has raised over $16M for its blockchain-focused revival","The project's LWMR token will be listed on top exchanges in the coming days.","Limewire said May 9 that it raised more than $16 million for its revived platform through sales of its cryptocurrency token (LMWR).

Limewire surpasses $15M goal

By raising $16.5 million, Limewire has surpassed its $15 million funding goal and is more than halfway to its $30 million fundraising limit.

The project’s website says that the sale will close on May 11 and that the token will be listed on four major exchanges beginning on May 16.

The project raised funds in fiat as well as cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC) USD Coin (USDC), Tether (USD), and Binance Coin (BNB). It added support for XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC) payments around May 6.

Limewire previously announced on April 21 that it had raised $10 million through a private sale led by led by Kraken Ventures, Arrington Capital, and GSR.

NFT platform for creators

Limewire is best known as a file-sharing service active in the early 2000s. The platform became controversial for enabling copyright infringement of music and faced lawsuits from the recording industry. Limewire was eventually shut down circa 2010.

However, Limewire’s revived version will instead serve as a platform for music artists. Creators will be able to create content on blockchain-based content and monetize that content with cryptocurrency rewards, payments, and subscriptions.

Content on the platform will be stored and traded as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and access to that content can be gated behind NFTs and other tokens.

"Coinbase ex-manager gets 2-year sentence for insider trading","Coinbase's former product manager, Ishan Wahi got sentenced to two years in prison by the US authorities.","The U.S. authorities sentenced Coinbase‘s former Product Manager to two years in jail for insider trading, according to Reuters.

On May 9, 2023, the prosecutors decided Ishan Wahi’s sentence for participating in a scheme that involved “massive abuse” of Coinbase’s trust, the Reuters article noted.

Background of the case

In January, Ishan Wahi’s brother Nikhil Wahi got sentenced to 10 months in prison for the same reason – making trades based on confidential Coinbase information. At the time, Nikhil Wahi admitted that it was his brother Ishan Wahi who leaked the information to him and his friend, Sameer Ramani.

Based on the information Ishan Wahi leaked, Ramani and Nikhil Wahi used anonymous wallets and made over $1 million on trades between July 2021 and May 2022. Ishan Wahi was arrested together with his brother, Nikhil Wahi, in January. However, Ishan Wahi pleaded not guilty, while Ramani was outside the U.S. borders.

In February, Ishan Wahi filed a lawsuit and asked the U.S. authorities to dismiss the charges against him. Wahi claimed the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lacked legal authority to classify tokens as securities. Wahi’s lawyers contended that the assets and asset holders involved in the case were not a part of any “common enterprise” since tokens are not considered an investment contract. Therefore, the insider trading charges were inapplicable.

The court decision

According to Reuters, Wahi said he “made a huge mistake” that will follow him for the rest of his life. Assistant U.S. Attorney Noah Solowiejczyk responded by stating that this was not a simple “one-off mistake” but a stream of tips scattered over ten months.

Wahi asked the court for a sentence that was no longer his brother’s. During his brother Nikhil Wahi’s hearing, the prosecutors recommended Nikhil Wahi be sentenced to prison for at least ten months. Nikhil Wahi’s defense lawyers managed to settle for the least by claiming that 26-year-old Wahi’s primary motivation was to repay his college debt, and he hadn’t been arrested before.

In the case of Ishan Wahi, the prosecutors recommended he spend more than three years in jail. Ishan Wahi noted that other crypto-related insider trading cases usually resulted in little or no prison time. However, the court sentenced him to two years in prison for the civil counterpart of using deception to seek financial gain.

"PayPal customers increase crypto deposits to $943M","PayPal's latest Form 10-Q filing shows crypto deposits are up 56% - but how much relates to fresh deposits versus dollar value increases?","PayPal disclosed it holds $943 million in customers’ crypto assets, up 56% from the previous quarter.

The company enables users in some regions to buy, hold, sell, and pay for purchases using cryptocurrency. However, PayPal doesn’t have any cryptocurrencies on its balance sheet other than those belonging to its customers.

PayPal customers up their deposits

In its latest Q1 2023 Form 10-Q SEC filing, the online payments firm revealed that customers’ crypto deposits jumped from $604 million in the prior quarter to $943 million as of March 31.

The table below shows Bitcoin was the most popular in terms of current holdings and quarter-over-quarter percentage increase – spiking 71% to just short of half a billion dollars.

The pattern repeated, with the second-most held cryptocurrency, Ethereum seeing a 45% increase in deposits. While “Other,” consisting of Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin, saw gains of plus 30%.

Source: investor.pypl.com

PayPal stated that the risks of accounting for cryptocurrency, including “technological, legal, and regulatory risks,” meant crypto assets are recorded as both a liability and an asset on their books.

Hodl

Last year was a tumultuous one for cryptocurrency, characterized by CeFi bankruptcies, particularly the FTX scandal.

Nonetheless, by the first quarter of 2023, the total crypto market cap saw a significant increase of 49%, rising from $796 billion on December 31st, 2022, to $1,183 billion on March 31st, 2023 – suggesting the market has recovered to a degree.

Without a detailed breakdown of PayPal customers’ holdings, it is unclear precisely how much of the 56% quarter-over-quarter increase in deposits relates to increased crypto holdings or the increase in dollar value over that period.

However, using the crude measure of a 49% increase in total market cap between quarters, it is probable that the majority of the increase relates to an increase in the dollar value of holdings – rather than a jump in customers’ deposits.

"Binance’s NFT marketplace to support Bitcoin Ordinals","The total number of Bitcoin NFTs spiked above 5 million earlier today after a recent surge in activity, according to Dune analytics data.","Crypto exchange Binance said its marketplace would enable support for Bitcoin (BTC) Ordinals.

In a May 8 statement, Binance said it was enabling support for Bitcoin NFTs to elevate its marketplace to a multi-chain, open marketplace ecosystem, where users can explore and trade a variety of NFTs across multiple blockchains from their accounts.

“Binance NFT believes Bitcoin’s innovative technology and cultural significance represent an exciting new horizon, offering unique opportunities for NFT creation.”

The support would enable the exchange users to trade these NFTs directly from their accounts while enjoying its platform’s security and stability.

Binance said it would offer Bitcoin NFT creators royalties when their assets are bought and sold on its platform.

Bitcoin Ordinal Inscriptions cross 5 million

The number of Bitcoin NFTs spiked above 5 million after a recent surge in activity mainly consisting of text-based assets, data from Dune analytics show.

CryptoSlate Insight reported that these Inscriptions had generated a cumulative fee of 904 Bitcoin, benefiting BTC miners. As of press time, this has risen to 1,019 BTC ($27.64 million), according to Dune analytics data.

Source: Dune Analytics

The increase has followed the introduction of the Bitcoin Request for Comment (BRC-20) token standard, which allows users to transferable assets directly through the blockchain network.

In the last 24 hours, there were 241,880 unique inscriptions on Bitcoin, of which 193,349 were text-based. There were less than 500 inscriptions of images, applications, and tokens during the period.

According to the brc-20.io website, BRC-20 tokens have a total market cap of over $1 billion — with the top token being Ordi, valued at $471.47 million.

Meanwhile, the BRC-20 tokens have a cumulative volume of over $207 million during the last 24 hours.

The current BTC NFTs drive has pushed the average network fees to $30.91 — a level not seen since April 2021.

"Microsoft, Goldman, others partner for privacy-enabled blockchain Canton Network","Canton Network would launch in July when the network participants would test its interoperability capabilities.","Digital Asset, alongside several traditional financial firms and technology giants, are partnering to launch Canton Network — a privacy-enabled blockchain network designed for institutional assets.

According to a May 9 press statement, the new network would be launched in July when the network participants  — which include the likes of Goldman Sachs, Cumberland, S&P Global, SBI Digital Asset Holdings, Umbrage, Microsoft, Paxos, Deloitte, CBOE, and others —  would test its interoperability capabilities across a range of applications and use cases.

With Canton Network’s design, traditional financial institutions can offer users new innovative products and experience a safer and reconciliation-free environment where assets, data, and cash can synchronize freely across applications.

“[Canton Network] creates a ‘network of networks’, allowing previously siloed systems in financial markets to interoperate with the appropriate governance, privacy, permissioning and controls required for highly regulated industries.”

A Deloitte Consulting principal, Joseph Cody, said the blockchain network is the first of its kind, adding that the Canton Network can help with the “tokenization of assets, facilitating rapid cross-organizational settlement, creating new marketplaces, and establishing an immutable record of shared data, and facilitating secure transactions.”

Canton is built on Digital Asset’s smart contract language, Daml.

How Canton Network differs from rival blockchains

Canton Network says it combines the smart contract capabilities of blockchain networks like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) with privacy features similar to those on Bitcoin Lightning and ZCash (ZEC).

According to its white paper, this helps to differentiate it from other blockchain networks, which are limited in their operations. Some of these networks’ limitations include their layer1 strict, vertical limits on transaction capacity. Another challenge of these networks was that asset issuers had to forfeit control of that asset to a pool of pseudonymous validators.

“From a regulatory perspective, the data transparency and loss of control over assets make these networks unsuitable for use by financial institutions.”

Canton Network says it helps solve these limitations by enabling applications across multiple subnets to natively interoperate without requiring a layer 2 protocol or asset bridge.

“As of early 2023, financial institutions transact over $50 billion daily on limited-access subnets of the Canton Network.”

"Coinbase’s Paul Grewal says SEC proposed custody rule ‘unnecessarily singles out crypto’","Coinbase suggests a more inclusive approach to qualified custodians and a unified possession or control standard for crypto assets for SEC's proposed custody rules.","Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal spoke up against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s proposed revisions to federal custody requirements that require registered investment advisers (RIAs) to hold client assets at qualified custodians.

The exchange officially added its comments regarding the proposed rule on May 8, the deadline for submission.

Grewal’s tweets come after Marisa Tashman Coppel, Policy Counsel for the Blockchain Association, warned on May 8 that the SEC’s rule change could “drastically curtail” crypto investment.

Grewal said in a Twitter thread that the exchange agrees with the “spirit of the proposal.”

He added:

“We’re confident Coinbase Custody Trust Company will remain a QC even if the proposal is adopted as is.”

Comments on SEC proposal

In its comments, among other issues, Coinbase disagreed with the SEC’s proposition to shift the types of banks allowed to serve as qualified custodians to include only those “subject to Federal regulation and supervision” and believes state trust companies and other state-regulated financial institutions should continue to be qualified custodians.

“The Proposal contains no policy explanation or economic analysis that would support changing the scope of banks eligible to serve as qualified custodians,” Coinbase noted in its comments, adding that such a rule requires more reasoning, reviewing alternatives, and cost-benefit analysis than the proposal provides.

Coinbase also believes the proposal requirement by the SEC for RIAs to maintain possession or control of client assets at all times is  “to justify banning RIA client trades on crypto exchanges that are not qualified custodians and require pre-funding to execute transactions.”

The company believes the proposal should allow client assets to temporarily leave the qualified custodian so advisers can execute and settle trades within one day after the transaction. It contends that this restriction on crypto asset trading does not consider the reasoning for crypto exchanges pre-funding transactions or the real-time settlement benefit it provides.

Grewal said in his Twitter thread that:

“[T]his proposal unnecessarily singles out crypto and makes inappropriate assumptions about custodial practices based on securities markets.”

According to Coinbase, the SEC must implement a “unified possession or control standard” that enables consumers to hold crypto assets at a wider range of qualified custodians. The company noted that the proposal in its current form would be detrimental to broker-dealers, holding them to a higher custodial standard for crypto assets than banks and foreign financial institutions, and believes broker-dealers should custody crypto assets under the same requirements as other asset classes.

Coinbase also suggested other amendments to the proposal, such as tailoring indemnification and insurance requirements by asset class and allowing sophisticated investors to negotiate custodial arrangements.

Grewal ended the thread by saying:

“We appreciate the chance to weigh in and we look forward to engaging with the SEC to get this right – public rulemaking is a critical step in bringing further clarity to the market.”

Coinbase vs. SEC

Coinbase has been embroiled in a legal battle with the SEC ever since it received a Wells Notice in March. Since then, the exchange has repeatedly spoken out against the SEC’s regulations.

The exchange recently procured a court order that compels the SEC to respond to the exchange’s mandamus petition that asked the SEC to use its rulemaking process to develop guidance for companies in the crypto industry.

"‘Kim Jong-Un’ gets approved for Gate.io crypto account","Gate.io's account verification has come under scrutiny after ZachXBT tested its KYC process.","An account application under the name Kim Jong-Un cleared Gate.io’s Know Your Customer (KYC) checks and was approved within minutes.

Gate.io KYC process draws scrutiny

On-chain sleuth, ZachXBT, sought to test the hypothesis that crypto exchange accounts provide a degree of security when tracking down stolen funds.

“When stolen funds go to a crypto exchange people like to assume that there is a real person with a real identity tied to an account“

To debunk this, he applied for a Gate.io account with the name Kim Jong-Un and an email address  “notlazarus.” ZachXBT screenshotted the application approval showing he had passed KYC and was cleared to trade cryptocurrencies on the exchange.

Furthermore, the company’s “KYC-1” basic verification tier enabled the account holder to withdraw up to 100,000 USDT daily.

It’s unclear whether ZachXBT had altered ID documentation to get to this point. Nonetheless, the outcome highlighted flaws in Gate.io’s application process – particularly with regard to name checks.

To hammer home the point, ZachXBT repeated this process using made-up names and names listed on the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions list with email addresses such as “harmonyhacker” and “lazaruslover” – all of which were approved – thus contradicting the idea that bad actors shy away from using exchanges.


The Lazarus Group refers to a collective of hackers and scammers, reportedly under the direction of the North Korean government.

The group employs many strategies, including malware, as used in the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack. And social engineering, such as baiting a senior Axie Infinity engineer to open a “job offer” file, subsequently infecting the engineer’s computer and leading to several Axie nodes being seized.

Know Your Customer

To meet Financial Action Task Force (FATF) compliance, crypto exchanges have been incorporating mandatory KYC requirements – with ByBit becoming the latest to fall in line. The company announced that all users will need to upload ID starting from May 8.

KYC critics argue that the practice limits crypto participation. Moreover, bad actors have the means and know-how to easily bypass checks – making KYC pointless in terms of achieving its goal of stopping money laundering.

Also, as demonstrated in the Ledger data breach in July 2020, storing customer information provides hackers with an additional avenue of attack. Ledger customers were threatened and doxxed after their contact information was made public.

CryptoSlate reached out to Gate.io for comment on ZachXBT’s findings. No comment was received at the time of press.

"OKX sends over $60M in crypto to Alameda’s wallet","Crypto exchange OKX made 16 transactions — which included 10 deposits of $5 million USDT — to the bankrupt firm’s wallet.","OKX sent over $60 million worth of crypto assets to bankrupt Alameda Research’s wallet in the last five hours, according to Arkham Intelligence data.

The crypto exchange made 16 transactions — which included 10 deposits of $5 million USDT and 337,859 MASK (roughly $1.30 million) — to the bankrupt firm’s wallet.

Source: Arkham Intelligence

In March, OKX said it would return $157 million in frozen assets from the bankrupt crypto firm. At the time, the exchange said the funds were seized after FTX collapsed in November 2022.

OKX had promised to cooperate with FTX debtors and law enforcement officials to return any funds linked to the bankrupt firm on its platform.

During the last seven days, the Alameda wallet has received over 1 million Stargate tokens (STG) and over 5 billion units of the GPEPE meme coin from an unknown wallet.

Meanwhile, Alameda wallet showed that its largest crypto holding was $61.40 million USDT. Other top holdings of the firm included 100 million BitDAO (BIT) tokens worth $48.61 million, 19,292 Ethereum (ETH) worth $26.5 million, $12.35 million USDC, 28.9 million Stargate tokens worth $18.43 million and 16.39 million Polygon tokens worth $14.63 million.

Its other holdings include altcoins like Lido (LDO), FTX Token (FTT), Serum (SRM), etc.

Cumulatively, it holds crypto assets worth $285.86 million.

FTX creditors have continued efforts to recover the exchange’s assets. The bankrupt firm has moved to claw back $3.9 billion from Genesis and has been involved in selling several assets belonging to the company.

Besides that, there is increased speculation that suggests the possibility of FTX restarting operations. A recent court filing confirmed plans to restart FTX’s Japanese subsidiary.

"Crypto investment products recorded over $50M in outflows – almost all from BTC","Bitcoin-based investment products lost $54.9 million as the overall market closed at outflows for the third consecutive week.","Crypto-based investment products market recorded $53.7 million in outflows during the week of May 1-7, with Bitcoin (BTC) based products accounting for almost all, according to CoinShares’ weekly report.

BTC and short-BTC-based products recorded a total of $54.9 million in outflows, as the CoinShares report noted.

Weekly asset flows (Source: CoinShares)

The week of May 1-7 also marked the third consecutive week of outflows for the crypto investment products market.

The market’s last outflows streak started in February and lasted six weeks straight. The aggregate value lost during this period reached $408 million, with the largest recorded during the week of Mar. 6 – 12 with $225 million.

Flows by asset

BTC and Short-BTC-based products were almost entirely responsible for the weekly outflows. Within seven days, BTC lost $31.8 million, while short-BTC products saw $23.1 million in withdrawals.

Flows by the asset (Source: CoinShares)

This is particularly unusual for short-BTC products. Even when the market was on its six-week-outflows streak, short-BTC products recorded inflows almost every week. Acknowledging this irregularity, the CoinShares report stated that this was the “largest weekly outflows from short-bitcoin on record of US$23m.”

Other than BTC, Ethereum (ETH) also closed the week on the negative by recording $2.3 million in withdrawals. In return, multi-asset and Solana (SOL)-based products saw inflows worth $100,000 and $3.4 million, respectively, bringing the overall market score to -$53.7 million.

Flows by country

Looking at asset movements on a geographical basis Germany and Canada comes forward by recording the most significant outflows of the week. Germany saw $27.1 million in withdrawals, while Canada recorded $19.6 million in outflows. The two nations accounted for 86% of the total outflow amount of the week.

Flows by exchange country (Source: CoinShares)

The US, Switzerland, and Brazil also contributed to the withdrawals by recording $4.5 million, $3.5 million, and $300,000 in outflows, respectively. On the other hand, only $1.3 million worth of inflows were brought to the market by Sweden.

When the movements are filtered based on the providers, only Purpose Investments comes forward with $1 million in inflows. 3iQ, CoinShares, and ProShares recorded $19.4 million, $13.4 million, and $5.4 million in outflows, respectively.

"Block Size War 2.0 heats up as Bitcoin SV spikes 33%","Bitcoin SV proponents maintain that BSV's bigger block size and lower fees make it a better Bitcoin than BTC.","Bitcoin SV has surged 33% over the last 24 hours — while Bitcoin falters as rising transaction fees and chain bloat from Ordinals transactions take hold.

Is Bitcoin SV a better Bitcoin?

Buyers have flocked to Bitcoin SV, triggering a nearly threefold increase in trading volume since May 8. At press time, BSV spiked to $40.44, marking a nine-week high for the controversial cryptocurrency.

Despite leading the top 100 off the back of this performance, BSV posted its all-time low on May 8, bottoming at $29.17. Moreover, the token is down 92% from its $490 all-time high — achieved in April 2021.

BSV was established in November 2018 by hard forking from Bitcoin Cash, which in turn had hard forked from the original chain in August 2017.

Founders Craig Wright and Calvin Ayre claim BSV fulfills Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision of a peer-to-peer (P2P) electronic money system — as set out in the original whitepaper.

BSV offers block sizes of up to 4 GB in differentiating itself from rivals, more than a thousand times greater than Bitcoin’s 4 MB block size limit.

Furthermore, since its inception, BSV has incorporated script commands enabling native tokens, smart contracts, and other Ethereum-like capabilities. Bitcoin followed suit in November 2021 with the Taproot upgrade — which later spawned the Ordinals Protocol.

BSV proponents point to the chain’s purported 50,000 transactions per second throughput and low transaction fees as reasons BSV is a better Bitcoin.

Per bitinfocharts.com, BSV transaction fees have spiked recently but remain relatively low at an average price of $0.0374. Meanwhile, average Bitcoin fees hit $31.91 as users pile into BRC-20 tokens — congesting the network.

Ordinals woes

Given the objective advantages of BSV over BTC, the issue of enlarging BTC’s block size is once again doing the rounds.

A larger block size enables greater scalability as more transactions (or other data use cases) can fit into a single block — increasing capacity and lowering the average transaction fee. However, the tradeoff comes at the expense of decentralization — as fewer people are prepared to run a node that operates using high bandwidth.

Commenting on the calls for BTC to increase its block size, Analyst Dylan LeClair planted his flag in the ground, calling advocates of the idea “morons.”

Mark Harvey acknowledged that Ordinals had significantly strained BTC’s block size capacity. However, referring to the first block size war, he pointed out that Bitcoin Cash “slowly bled out to irrelevance.”

The chart below shows BSV hitting a high of 0.034 against BTC in early 2020. Since that peak, BSV has experienced a steep downtrend followed by a gradual drop-off from May 2021 onwards.

To remedy the congestion and network bloat, Bitcoin devs are looking at incorporating spam filters on Ordinals transactions, per @frankdegods.

"DeBridge launch trading infrastructure product without liquidity pool","DeBridge's DLN API is asset-agnostic, meaning users can send any crypto asset across the trading infrastructure.","Cross-chain infrastructure developer deBridge has launched deSwap Liquidity Network (DLN) API — a trading infrastructure designed to enable high-performance interoperability without a liquidity pool.

According to a press statement shared with CryptoSlate, the DLN API is built on the deBridge cross-chain messaging layer and enables a new level of improved speed, scalability, and user experience.

DLN eliminates the need for liquidity pools for cross-chain transfers. This way, any protocol or decentralized application can offer an almost instant native cross-chain trading of any amount without slippage.

By not using liquidity pools, the new API promises deep, liquid interoperability with Maximal extractable value (MEV) protection. The deep liquidity comes from the fact that DLN efficiently draws liquidity from the whole DeFi market instead of just one liquidity pool.

DLN API also removes the risks and limitations of liquidity pools. This is especially important considering how liquidity pools and cross-chain bridge vulnerabilities have caused more than $2 billion in losses for DeFi protocols.

Additionally, it also promises faster and more capital-efficient trades. Transactions with DLN would be settled in seconds or minutes, and users don’t have to pay automated market makers or lose capital to MEV bots.

“DLN zero-TVL creates the first sustainable mechanism for cross-chain liquidity trading by enabling value accrual without the need to continuously distribute any liquidity mining rewards.”

According to deBridge’s website, any project can integrate with its DLN using the live API or interacting directly with the smart contract. It also noted that “DLN is completely asset-agnostic, meaning that you can place an order giving wBTC or FTT, or any other asset.”

This new tool is the latest in the line of products from deBridge, focusing on helping DeFi applications scale faster with better capital efficiency. DeBridge Finance has already built several solutions like deSwap, deNFT, and dePort to help users’ experience.

DLN currently supports Arbitrum (ARB), Ethereum (ETH), BNB Chain, Polygon (MATIC), and Avalanche (AVAX).

"Bitcoin transaction fees surge to 24-month high amid BRC-20 memecoin mania","The average Bitcoin transaction fee has surged to a massive $30.91 in light of degens aping into BRC-20 tokens.","The average Bitcoin transaction fee has surged to $30.91 — a level not seen since April 2021, per data from ycharts.com.

Source: ycharts.com

The period in the run-up to April 2021 was characterized by a mania that saw Bitcoin run to $64,900 — likely driven by Coinbase’s NASDAQ listing and the narrative that crypto is going mainstream.

This run ended abruptly as China extended its anti-crypto policy to ban Proof-of-Work mining, followed by Elon Musk announcing Tesla would stop accepting BTC for vehicle purchases due to concerns over miners using fossil fuels.

Today, meme coin mania is driving activity on the Bitcoin network via the recently released BRC-20 standard.

What is BRC-20?

In March, the BRC-20 standard was created by an anonymous individual known as “Domo.”

While Bitcoin was traditionally a single-asset blockchain, the Ordinals protocol, via the Taproot soft fork, has enabled fungible BRC-20 assets to operate on the chain.

Taproot launched in November 2021 to make transactions quicker and cost-effective while laying the groundwork for smart contracts and dApps.

By February, Taproot’s capabilities were being used to store jpegs and videos directly on the blockchain, consequently creating a non-fungible market on Bitcoin — much to the annoyance of purists.

At the time, commentators warned that this would eventually lead to higher transaction fees and chain bloat – with BRC-20 added to the mix, that situation is playing out.

According to the brc-20.io website, BRC-20 tokens have a total market cap of $693.2 million. The top three tokens are Ordi, Nals, and Pepe —valued at $411.3 million, $42.3 million, and $34.7 million, respectively.

Scrolling the list shows tokens named d*ck, P*SY, sexy, and f*ck, indicating the general triviality of the BRC-20 space at this time.

Bitcoin casino

Despite this, echoing a comment from RamenPanda, foobar is adamant that BRC-20 tokens will be a significant factor in rising Bitcoin dominance, making Ethereum irrelevant.

“Next bull market will be driven by Bitcoin and BRC20 tokens

Bitcoin dominance will skyrocket to above 70%

Ethereum will become irrelevant.”

Similarly, Degen Spartan expressed a “can’t beat ’em, join ’em” attitude towards BRC-20 — saying if you’re going to memecoin, you might as well do it on Bitcoin.

“The eventual conclusion of the janky brc20 experiment will be that it is better to shitcoin on a chain purpose built to house and facilitate a full suite shitcoin casino.“

Willy Woo said there are pros and cons to the current situation. He explained that block rewards will be zero one day, meaning an alternative source of mining revenue is needed to keep miners incentivized.

At the same time, the trade-off is “bad for nodes and decentralisation” — adding that the impact of Ordinals is happening at a time when mining rewards are still high.

"SBF says most charges against him ‘suffer from multiple legal flaws’","Sam Bankman-Fried's lawyers argue that the charges against him ""suffer from multiple legal flaws"" or were ""improperly premised.""","FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried filed pretrial motions to dismiss 10 of the 13 charges against him, according to a May 8 court filing.

According to a memorandum of law filed by the SBF lawyers, the prosecutors hastily charged their client in a rush to judgment. They added that the government did not review the case’s documents or other relevant evidence.

 “Each of the charges contained boilerplate recitals of statutory language, followed by literally one sentence purportedly describing the basis for the charge — nothing further.”

Due to this, SBF wants the court to drop all charges except those alleging conspiracy to commit securities fraud, securities fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.

SBF says charges against him are flawed

The lawyers highlighted how the other charges “suffer from multiple legal flaws” or were  “improperly premised on a ‘right to control’ theory” recently considered invalid by the Solicitor General.

For context, the lawyers said the commodities fraud charges fail to satisfy the statutory requirement. FinCEN’s rules undercut other charges like the unlicensed money transmitter charge, the campaign finance charge is self-contradictory, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act is vague and improperly pleaded.

The lawyers concluded that:

“The Government’s haste and apparent willingness to proceed without having all the relevant facts and information has produced an indictment that is not only improperly brought but legally flawed and should be dismissed.”

Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas in December 2022 following FTX’s bankruptcy in November of the same year. Since then, he has been extradited to the U.S., where he faces multiple charges bordering on his role in the eventual collapse of the exchange.

Meanwhile, unlike other FTX’s top executives, SBF has pleaded not guilty to all charges and is currently on bail.

"Blockchain Association objects to SEC’s proposed custody rule change","The proposal is ""unlawful"" and could impact the crypto industry, one member said.","The Blockchain Association said May 8 that it objects to a custody rule change proposed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Industry group objects to SEC proposal

Marisa Tashman Coppel, Policy Counsel for the Blockchain Association, warned that the SEC’s rule change could “drastically curtail” crypto investment.

She said, on behalf of the Blockchain Association:

“The proposed rule deviates from the SEC’s obligation … to take an asset-neutral approach. … Rather than allowing for flexibility … the proposed rule discourages custodians and advisers from offering digital asset-related services. “

Coppel explained that the proposal prevents investment advisers from engaging in self-custody of assets. She said that the new rule could make acting as a qualified custodian unaffordable and could prevent advisers from providing the safest custody possible.

She added that the rule change could restrict certain activities such as staking and trading if those services are not operated by a central intermediary or qualified custodian.

Coppel also suggested that digital assets allow for new custody models, such as the decentralized custody model called multi-party computation (MPC). This model, which is used by Fireblocks, may not be permissible under the proposed rules, Coppel said.

Coppel added that rules around indemnification (i.e., loss coverage) and asset segregation could cause difficulties for advisers. The fact that the proposed rule applies broadly to all assets without authorization from U.S Congress additionally makes the proposal an “unlawful expansion” of the SEC’s authority, Coppel concluded.

These statements are Coppel’s explanation of a longer letter published by the Blockchain Association Itself, which represents over 100 member companies.

Controversy began in February

The controversy around the rule change first began on February 15, when the SEC proposed the new rule. SEC commissioner Hester Peirce soon expressed her dissent toward the proposal and cited its potential impact on crypto as one concern.

However, several leading crypto platforms, including Coinbase, BitGo, Anchorage Digital, and Gemini have endorsed the proposal. Those companies suggested they were already compliant with the proposed rule change and would not be affected by the change.

"Coinbase’s Paul Grewal says SEC proposed custody rule ‘unnecessarily singles out crypto’","Coinbase suggests a more inclusive approach to qualified custodians and a unified possession or control standard for crypto assets for SEC's proposed custody rules.","Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal spoke up against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s proposed revisions to federal custody requirements that require registered investment advisers (RIAs) to hold client assets at qualified custodians.

The exchange officially added its comments regarding the proposed rule on May 8, the deadline for submission.

Grewal’s tweets come after Marisa Tashman Coppel, Policy Counsel for the Blockchain Association, warned on May 8 that the SEC’s rule change could “drastically curtail” crypto investment.

Grewal said in a Twitter thread that the exchange agrees with the “spirit of the proposal.”

He added:

“We’re confident Coinbase Custody Trust Company will remain a QC even if the proposal is adopted as is.”

Comments on SEC proposal

In its comments, among other issues, Coinbase disagreed with the SEC’s proposition to shift the types of banks allowed to serve as qualified custodians to include only those “subject to Federal regulation and supervision” and believes state trust companies and other state-regulated financial institutions should continue to be qualified custodians.

“The Proposal contains no policy explanation or economic analysis that would support changing the scope of banks eligible to serve as qualified custodians,” Coinbase noted in its comments, adding that such a rule requires more reasoning, reviewing alternatives, and cost-benefit analysis than the proposal provides.

Coinbase also believes the proposal requirement by the SEC for RIAs to maintain possession or control of client assets at all times is  “to justify banning RIA client trades on crypto exchanges that are not qualified custodians and require pre-funding to execute transactions.”

The company believes the proposal should allow client assets to temporarily leave the qualified custodian so advisers can execute and settle trades within one day after the transaction. It contends that this restriction on crypto asset trading does not consider the reasoning for crypto exchanges pre-funding transactions or the real-time settlement benefit it provides.

Grewal said in his Twitter thread that:

“[T]his proposal unnecessarily singles out crypto and makes inappropriate assumptions about custodial practices based on securities markets.”

According to Coinbase, the SEC must implement a “unified possession or control standard” that enables consumers to hold crypto assets at a wider range of qualified custodians. The company noted that the proposal in its current form would be detrimental to broker-dealers, holding them to a higher custodial standard for crypto assets than banks and foreign financial institutions, and believes broker-dealers should custody crypto assets under the same requirements as other asset classes.

Coinbase also suggested other amendments to the proposal, such as tailoring indemnification and insurance requirements by asset class and allowing sophisticated investors to negotiate custodial arrangements.

Grewal ended the thread by saying:

“We appreciate the chance to weigh in and we look forward to engaging with the SEC to get this right – public rulemaking is a critical step in bringing further clarity to the market.”

Coinbase vs. SEC

Coinbase has been embroiled in a legal battle with the SEC ever since it received a Wells Notice in March. Since then, the exchange has repeatedly spoken out against the SEC’s regulations.

The exchange recently procured a court order that compels the SEC to respond to the exchange’s mandamus petition that asked the SEC to use its rulemaking process to develop guidance for companies in the crypto industry.

"‘Kim Jong-Un’ gets approved for Gate.io crypto account","Gate.io's account verification has come under scrutiny after ZachXBT tested its KYC process.","An account application under the name Kim Jong-Un cleared Gate.io’s Know Your Customer (KYC) checks and was approved within minutes.

Gate.io KYC process draws scrutiny

On-chain sleuth, ZachXBT, sought to test the hypothesis that crypto exchange accounts provide a degree of security when tracking down stolen funds.

“When stolen funds go to a crypto exchange people like to assume that there is a real person with a real identity tied to an account“

To debunk this, he applied for a Gate.io account with the name Kim Jong-Un and an email address  “notlazarus.” ZachXBT screenshotted the application approval showing he had passed KYC and was cleared to trade cryptocurrencies on the exchange.

Furthermore, the company’s “KYC-1” basic verification tier enabled the account holder to withdraw up to 100,000 USDT daily.

It’s unclear whether ZachXBT had altered ID documentation to get to this point. Nonetheless, the outcome highlighted flaws in Gate.io’s application process – particularly with regard to name checks.

To hammer home the point, ZachXBT repeated this process using made-up names and names listed on the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions list with email addresses such as “harmonyhacker” and “lazaruslover” – all of which were approved – thus contradicting the idea that bad actors shy away from using exchanges.


The Lazarus Group refers to a collective of hackers and scammers, reportedly under the direction of the North Korean government.

The group employs many strategies, including malware, as used in the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack. And social engineering, such as baiting a senior Axie Infinity engineer to open a “job offer” file, subsequently infecting the engineer’s computer and leading to several Axie nodes being seized.

Know Your Customer

To meet Financial Action Task Force (FATF) compliance, crypto exchanges have been incorporating mandatory KYC requirements – with ByBit becoming the latest to fall in line. The company announced that all users will need to upload ID starting from May 8.

KYC critics argue that the practice limits crypto participation. Moreover, bad actors have the means and know-how to easily bypass checks – making KYC pointless in terms of achieving its goal of stopping money laundering.

Also, as demonstrated in the Ledger data breach in July 2020, storing customer information provides hackers with an additional avenue of attack. Ledger customers were threatened and doxxed after their contact information was made public.

CryptoSlate reached out to Gate.io for comment on ZachXBT’s findings. No comment was received at the time of press.

"OKX sends over $60M in crypto to Alameda’s wallet","Crypto exchange OKX made 16 transactions — which included 10 deposits of $5 million USDT — to the bankrupt firm’s wallet.","OKX sent over $60 million worth of crypto assets to bankrupt Alameda Research’s wallet in the last five hours, according to Arkham Intelligence data.

The crypto exchange made 16 transactions — which included 10 deposits of $5 million USDT and 337,859 MASK (roughly $1.30 million) — to the bankrupt firm’s wallet.

Source: Arkham Intelligence

In March, OKX said it would return $157 million in frozen assets from the bankrupt crypto firm. At the time, the exchange said the funds were seized after FTX collapsed in November 2022.

OKX had promised to cooperate with FTX debtors and law enforcement officials to return any funds linked to the bankrupt firm on its platform.

During the last seven days, the Alameda wallet has received over 1 million Stargate tokens (STG) and over 5 billion units of the GPEPE meme coin from an unknown wallet.

Meanwhile, Alameda wallet showed that its largest crypto holding was $61.40 million USDT. Other top holdings of the firm included 100 million BitDAO (BIT) tokens worth $48.61 million, 19,292 Ethereum (ETH) worth $26.5 million, $12.35 million USDC, 28.9 million Stargate tokens worth $18.43 million and 16.39 million Polygon tokens worth $14.63 million.

Its other holdings include altcoins like Lido (LDO), FTX Token (FTT), Serum (SRM), etc.

Cumulatively, it holds crypto assets worth $285.86 million.

FTX creditors have continued efforts to recover the exchange’s assets. The bankrupt firm has moved to claw back $3.9 billion from Genesis and has been involved in selling several assets belonging to the company.

Besides that, there is increased speculation that suggests the possibility of FTX restarting operations. A recent court filing confirmed plans to restart FTX’s Japanese subsidiary.

"Crypto investment products recorded over $50M in outflows – almost all from BTC","Bitcoin-based investment products lost $54.9 million as the overall market closed at outflows for the third consecutive week.","Crypto-based investment products market recorded $53.7 million in outflows during the week of May 1-7, with Bitcoin (BTC) based products accounting for almost all, according to CoinShares’ weekly report.

BTC and short-BTC-based products recorded a total of $54.9 million in outflows, as the CoinShares report noted.

Weekly asset flows (Source: CoinShares)

The week of May 1-7 also marked the third consecutive week of outflows for the crypto investment products market.

The market’s last outflows streak started in February and lasted six weeks straight. The aggregate value lost during this period reached $408 million, with the largest recorded during the week of Mar. 6 – 12 with $225 million.

Flows by asset

BTC and Short-BTC-based products were almost entirely responsible for the weekly outflows. Within seven days, BTC lost $31.8 million, while short-BTC products saw $23.1 million in withdrawals.

Flows by the asset (Source: CoinShares)

This is particularly unusual for short-BTC products. Even when the market was on its six-week-outflows streak, short-BTC products recorded inflows almost every week. Acknowledging this irregularity, the CoinShares report stated that this was the “largest weekly outflows from short-bitcoin on record of US$23m.”

Other than BTC, Ethereum (ETH) also closed the week on the negative by recording $2.3 million in withdrawals. In return, multi-asset and Solana (SOL)-based products saw inflows worth $100,000 and $3.4 million, respectively, bringing the overall market score to -$53.7 million.

Flows by country

Looking at asset movements on a geographical basis Germany and Canada comes forward by recording the most significant outflows of the week. Germany saw $27.1 million in withdrawals, while Canada recorded $19.6 million in outflows. The two nations accounted for 86% of the total outflow amount of the week.

Flows by exchange country (Source: CoinShares)

The US, Switzerland, and Brazil also contributed to the withdrawals by recording $4.5 million, $3.5 million, and $300,000 in outflows, respectively. On the other hand, only $1.3 million worth of inflows were brought to the market by Sweden.

When the movements are filtered based on the providers, only Purpose Investments comes forward with $1 million in inflows. 3iQ, CoinShares, and ProShares recorded $19.4 million, $13.4 million, and $5.4 million in outflows, respectively.

"Block Size War 2.0 heats up as Bitcoin SV spikes 33%","Bitcoin SV proponents maintain that BSV's bigger block size and lower fees make it a better Bitcoin than BTC.","Bitcoin SV has surged 33% over the last 24 hours — while Bitcoin falters as rising transaction fees and chain bloat from Ordinals transactions take hold.

Is Bitcoin SV a better Bitcoin?

Buyers have flocked to Bitcoin SV, triggering a nearly threefold increase in trading volume since May 8. At press time, BSV spiked to $40.44, marking a nine-week high for the controversial cryptocurrency.

Despite leading the top 100 off the back of this performance, BSV posted its all-time low on May 8, bottoming at $29.17. Moreover, the token is down 92% from its $490 all-time high — achieved in April 2021.

BSV was established in November 2018 by hard forking from Bitcoin Cash, which in turn had hard forked from the original chain in August 2017.

Founders Craig Wright and Calvin Ayre claim BSV fulfills Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision of a peer-to-peer (P2P) electronic money system — as set out in the original whitepaper.

BSV offers block sizes of up to 4 GB in differentiating itself from rivals, more than a thousand times greater than Bitcoin’s 4 MB block size limit.

Furthermore, since its inception, BSV has incorporated script commands enabling native tokens, smart contracts, and other Ethereum-like capabilities. Bitcoin followed suit in November 2021 with the Taproot upgrade — which later spawned the Ordinals Protocol.

BSV proponents point to the chain’s purported 50,000 transactions per second throughput and low transaction fees as reasons BSV is a better Bitcoin.

Per bitinfocharts.com, BSV transaction fees have spiked recently but remain relatively low at an average price of $0.0374. Meanwhile, average Bitcoin fees hit $31.91 as users pile into BRC-20 tokens — congesting the network.

Ordinals woes

Given the objective advantages of BSV over BTC, the issue of enlarging BTC’s block size is once again doing the rounds.

A larger block size enables greater scalability as more transactions (or other data use cases) can fit into a single block — increasing capacity and lowering the average transaction fee. However, the tradeoff comes at the expense of decentralization — as fewer people are prepared to run a node that operates using high bandwidth.

Commenting on the calls for BTC to increase its block size, Analyst Dylan LeClair planted his flag in the ground, calling advocates of the idea “morons.”

Mark Harvey acknowledged that Ordinals had significantly strained BTC’s block size capacity. However, referring to the first block size war, he pointed out that Bitcoin Cash “slowly bled out to irrelevance.”

The chart below shows BSV hitting a high of 0.034 against BTC in early 2020. Since that peak, BSV has experienced a steep downtrend followed by a gradual drop-off from May 2021 onwards.

To remedy the congestion and network bloat, Bitcoin devs are looking at incorporating spam filters on Ordinals transactions, per @frankdegods.

"DeBridge launch trading infrastructure product without liquidity pool","DeBridge's DLN API is asset-agnostic, meaning users can send any crypto asset across the trading infrastructure.","Cross-chain infrastructure developer deBridge has launched deSwap Liquidity Network (DLN) API — a trading infrastructure designed to enable high-performance interoperability without a liquidity pool.

According to a press statement shared with CryptoSlate, the DLN API is built on the deBridge cross-chain messaging layer and enables a new level of improved speed, scalability, and user experience.

DLN eliminates the need for liquidity pools for cross-chain transfers. This way, any protocol or decentralized application can offer an almost instant native cross-chain trading of any amount without slippage.

By not using liquidity pools, the new API promises deep, liquid interoperability with Maximal extractable value (MEV) protection. The deep liquidity comes from the fact that DLN efficiently draws liquidity from the whole DeFi market instead of just one liquidity pool.

DLN API also removes the risks and limitations of liquidity pools. This is especially important considering how liquidity pools and cross-chain bridge vulnerabilities have caused more than $2 billion in losses for DeFi protocols.

Additionally, it also promises faster and more capital-efficient trades. Transactions with DLN would be settled in seconds or minutes, and users don’t have to pay automated market makers or lose capital to MEV bots.

“DLN zero-TVL creates the first sustainable mechanism for cross-chain liquidity trading by enabling value accrual without the need to continuously distribute any liquidity mining rewards.”

According to deBridge’s website, any project can integrate with its DLN using the live API or interacting directly with the smart contract. It also noted that “DLN is completely asset-agnostic, meaning that you can place an order giving wBTC or FTT, or any other asset.”

This new tool is the latest in the line of products from deBridge, focusing on helping DeFi applications scale faster with better capital efficiency. DeBridge Finance has already built several solutions like deSwap, deNFT, and dePort to help users’ experience.

DLN currently supports Arbitrum (ARB), Ethereum (ETH), BNB Chain, Polygon (MATIC), and Avalanche (AVAX).

"Bitcoin transaction fees surge to 24-month high amid BRC-20 memecoin mania","The average Bitcoin transaction fee has surged to a massive $30.91 in light of degens aping into BRC-20 tokens.","The average Bitcoin transaction fee has surged to $30.91 — a level not seen since April 2021, per data from ycharts.com.

Source: ycharts.com

The period in the run-up to April 2021 was characterized by a mania that saw Bitcoin run to $64,900 — likely driven by Coinbase’s NASDAQ listing and the narrative that crypto is going mainstream.

This run ended abruptly as China extended its anti-crypto policy to ban Proof-of-Work mining, followed by Elon Musk announcing Tesla would stop accepting BTC for vehicle purchases due to concerns over miners using fossil fuels.

Today, meme coin mania is driving activity on the Bitcoin network via the recently released BRC-20 standard.

What is BRC-20?

In March, the BRC-20 standard was created by an anonymous individual known as “Domo.”

While Bitcoin was traditionally a single-asset blockchain, the Ordinals protocol, via the Taproot soft fork, has enabled fungible BRC-20 assets to operate on the chain.

Taproot launched in November 2021 to make transactions quicker and cost-effective while laying the groundwork for smart contracts and dApps.

By February, Taproot’s capabilities were being used to store jpegs and videos directly on the blockchain, consequently creating a non-fungible market on Bitcoin — much to the annoyance of purists.

At the time, commentators warned that this would eventually lead to higher transaction fees and chain bloat – with BRC-20 added to the mix, that situation is playing out.

According to the brc-20.io website, BRC-20 tokens have a total market cap of $693.2 million. The top three tokens are Ordi, Nals, and Pepe —valued at $411.3 million, $42.3 million, and $34.7 million, respectively.

Scrolling the list shows tokens named d*ck, P*SY, sexy, and f*ck, indicating the general triviality of the BRC-20 space at this time.

Bitcoin casino

Despite this, echoing a comment from RamenPanda, foobar is adamant that BRC-20 tokens will be a significant factor in rising Bitcoin dominance, making Ethereum irrelevant.

“Next bull market will be driven by Bitcoin and BRC20 tokens

Bitcoin dominance will skyrocket to above 70%

Ethereum will become irrelevant.”

Similarly, Degen Spartan expressed a “can’t beat ’em, join ’em” attitude towards BRC-20 — saying if you’re going to memecoin, you might as well do it on Bitcoin.

“The eventual conclusion of the janky brc20 experiment will be that it is better to shitcoin on a chain purpose built to house and facilitate a full suite shitcoin casino.“

Willy Woo said there are pros and cons to the current situation. He explained that block rewards will be zero one day, meaning an alternative source of mining revenue is needed to keep miners incentivized.

At the same time, the trade-off is “bad for nodes and decentralisation” — adding that the impact of Ordinals is happening at a time when mining rewards are still high.

"SBF says most charges against him ‘suffer from multiple legal flaws’","Sam Bankman-Fried's lawyers argue that the charges against him ""suffer from multiple legal flaws"" or were ""improperly premised.""","FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried filed pretrial motions to dismiss 10 of the 13 charges against him, according to a May 8 court filing.

According to a memorandum of law filed by the SBF lawyers, the prosecutors hastily charged their client in a rush to judgment. They added that the government did not review the case’s documents or other relevant evidence.

 “Each of the charges contained boilerplate recitals of statutory language, followed by literally one sentence purportedly describing the basis for the charge — nothing further.”

Due to this, SBF wants the court to drop all charges except those alleging conspiracy to commit securities fraud, securities fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.

SBF says charges against him are flawed

The lawyers highlighted how the other charges “suffer from multiple legal flaws” or were  “improperly premised on a ‘right to control’ theory” recently considered invalid by the Solicitor General.

For context, the lawyers said the commodities fraud charges fail to satisfy the statutory requirement. FinCEN’s rules undercut other charges like the unlicensed money transmitter charge, the campaign finance charge is self-contradictory, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act is vague and improperly pleaded.

The lawyers concluded that:

“The Government’s haste and apparent willingness to proceed without having all the relevant facts and information has produced an indictment that is not only improperly brought but legally flawed and should be dismissed.”

Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas in December 2022 following FTX’s bankruptcy in November of the same year. Since then, he has been extradited to the U.S., where he faces multiple charges bordering on his role in the eventual collapse of the exchange.

Meanwhile, unlike other FTX’s top executives, SBF has pleaded not guilty to all charges and is currently on bail.

"Blockchain Association objects to SEC’s proposed custody rule change","The proposal is ""unlawful"" and could impact the crypto industry, one member said.","The Blockchain Association said May 8 that it objects to a custody rule change proposed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Industry group objects to SEC proposal

Marisa Tashman Coppel, Policy Counsel for the Blockchain Association, warned that the SEC’s rule change could “drastically curtail” crypto investment.

She said, on behalf of the Blockchain Association:

“The proposed rule deviates from the SEC’s obligation … to take an asset-neutral approach. … Rather than allowing for flexibility … the proposed rule discourages custodians and advisers from offering digital asset-related services. “

Coppel explained that the proposal prevents investment advisers from engaging in self-custody of assets. She said that the new rule could make acting as a qualified custodian unaffordable and could prevent advisers from providing the safest custody possible.

She added that the rule change could restrict certain activities such as staking and trading if those services are not operated by a central intermediary or qualified custodian.

Coppel also suggested that digital assets allow for new custody models, such as the decentralized custody model called multi-party computation (MPC). This model, which is used by Fireblocks, may not be permissible under the proposed rules, Coppel said.

Coppel added that rules around indemnification (i.e., loss coverage) and asset segregation could cause difficulties for advisers. The fact that the proposed rule applies broadly to all assets without authorization from U.S Congress additionally makes the proposal an “unlawful expansion” of the SEC’s authority, Coppel concluded.

These statements are Coppel’s explanation of a longer letter published by the Blockchain Association Itself, which represents over 100 member companies.

Controversy began in February

The controversy around the rule change first began on February 15, when the SEC proposed the new rule. SEC commissioner Hester Peirce soon expressed her dissent toward the proposal and cited its potential impact on crypto as one concern.

However, several leading crypto platforms, including Coinbase, BitGo, Anchorage Digital, and Gemini have endorsed the proposal. Those companies suggested they were already compliant with the proposed rule change and would not be affected by the change.

"Bittrex files for US bankruptcy; will not halt global operations","The firm recently announced plans to halt U.S. operations after facing SEC charges.","Bittrex announced the bankruptcy of its U.S. entity on May 8.

The company said that it has decided to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in federal court in Delaware. It said that this decision only affects Bittrex Inc. and that its global platform, Bittrex Global, will continue to serve non-U.S. customers.

The company’s bankruptcy filing suggests that the firm has between $500 million and $1 billion in assets and between $500 million and $1 billion in liabilities. The filing additionally indicates that the firm has more than 100,000 creditors.

The company also said that U.S. customers who did not withdraw their funds from the platform when it closed at the end of April will regain access to their funds through proceedings, and that those funds remain “safe and secure.” 

SEC charges

The company previously received charges from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on April 17. Those charges alleged that Bittrex and its co-founder Bill Shihara failed to register its exchange platform with the regulator.

Later, on March 31, Bittrex said that it would halt U.S. operations by the end of April but did not suggest a bankruptcy filing at that time.

The exchange saw a fairly low trading volume of $5.6 million on May 8.

"Ripple pegs SEC lawsuit costs at $200M; plans Dubai expansion","CEO Brad Garlinghouse commented on his firm's attempts to find favorable regulation.","Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse discussed his company’s regulatory challenges at the Dubai Fintech Summit, CNBC reported on May 8.

There, Garlinghouse described the scale of Ripple’s ongoing legal conflict with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He said:

 “With the SEC … we will have spent $200 million defending ourselves against a lawsuit, which from its very beginning [people have said] doesn’t make a lot of sense.”

Garlinghouse added that this was the first time that he had shared the cost of the legal conflict publicly and argued that the U.S. is “definitely stuck” in terms of regulation.

In a separate tweet, Garlinghouse said that Ripple will expand to Dubai in response to the U.S. regulatory landscape. He said that 20% of Ripple’s customers are based in the MENA region, which has “clear regulatory regimes” and is becoming a global financial hub.

Ripple’s difficulties began in December 2020 when the SEC accused Ripple and its executives of violating securities regulations by selling XRP tokens.

Ripple is just one company that is attempting to fight the SEC. Crypto exchange Coinbase is also preparing to take on the SEC, as it has received a Wells notice from the regulator.

It is still unclear whether either challenge will succeed.

"Paxful reopening after month-long shutdown","The P2P crypto marketplace will restore market functionality in the coming days.","Paxful said May 8 that it will be reopening its services after a month-long shutdown.

The peer-to-peer crypto marketplace said that it will “gradually” restore market functions over the coming days. Paxful added on its website that its wallet remained functional during the shutdown and said that it provided users with access to alternative platforms.

Reports from Coindesk suggest that Paxful is now owned by a custodian who acts as a company director and “tie-breaker” alongside embattled co-founders Artur Schabeck and Ray Youssef. Coindesk obtained that information from Shabeck himself.

Strife between founders

Paxful first shut down operations on April 4, 2023. Though Paxful CEO Ray Youssef said in early private statements said the project team was “not sure if [Paxful] will come back,” Paxful itself suggested the halt was temporary on April 10.

Youssef later resigned from his position and contributed his personal company shares to a fund intended to compensate Paxful users.

The platform managed to restore access to 88% of funds by April 17. About $4.4 million remained frozen after that date due to a legal conflict between co-founders, as one party refused to pay compliance costs needed to unlock the funds.

Unlike many other companies that suspended user withdrawals over the course of 2022, Paxful has managed to recover without bankruptcy or restructuring proceedings.

"OpenAI CEO’s Worldcoin project launches wallet app","Worldcoin, founded by Sam Altman, is set to launch its WLD token this year.","Worldcoin, a cryptocurrency project co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, announced the launch of its cryptocurrency wallet on May 8.

Worldcoin wallet now, token later

The new wallet, titled “World App,” supports a beta version of Worldcoin (WLD) as well as third-party cryptocurrencies such as Wrapped Ethereum (WETH), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), USD Coin (USDC), and Maker’s DAI stablecoin (DAI).

Worldcoin itself is not currently in circulation but will be launched later this year. Users in eligible countries will be able to claim the token on a weekly or monthly basis. Users in the U.S. are not meant to hold the asset, WorldCoin said.

World App and Worldcoin are largely powered by the Ethereum blockchain and related technologies including account abstraction, ENS usernames, and Uniswap. The beta relies on Polygon while the final version will run on Ethereum rollups.

The project also relies on Ramp and MoonPay for fiat withdrawals and deposits.

Worldcoin focuses on AI, ID

Worldcoin attracted controversy beginning in 2021 due to its reliance on retina-scanning ID technology, which was frequently called “dystopian.”

The project addressed that concern today as it noted that World App integrates its World ID product, but on an optional basis. It said that the app does not “require any personal information” and said that users can delete their data instantly. It said that World ID keys are self-custodied, though users can back up those keys on cloud services.

Worldcoin also hinted at its artificial intelligence (AI) plans, noting that it aims to “empower individuals in the Age of AI” by providing “AI-funded UBI.”

Worldcoin is not directly related to OpenAI beyond the fact that Sam Altman has been involved in both firms. Altman has also held other roles in the tech industry, including various positions at the startup accelerator YCombinator between 2011 and 2019.

"Cardano’s Hoskinson says SEC actions debunk Ripple lawsuit conspiracy theory","XRP supporters have claimed that former SEC Director William Hinman's speech about Ethereum was proof it had the support of the regulator.","Cardano (ADA) founder Charles Hoskinson believes the recent anti-crypto moves by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) take away the legitimacy of the conspiracy theories being propagated regarding the legal tussle between the regulator and Ripple.

In a May 8 tweet, Hoskinson noted that the theory popularized by XRP holders that the SEC was antagonizing XRP because of Ethereum insider bribes was “conspiracy,” adding that recent regulatory actions against the crypto industry were proof of this being an “accurate” assessment.

“I said the concept that the entire SEC is united against ripple by bribes from ethereum insiders is a conspiracy. Given that now Coinbase, Kraken, Bittrex, Tron, and dozens of others have been hit, it seems more accurate then ever”

While the SEC v Ripple case is still ongoing, SEC chair Gary Gensler has described all digital assets except Bitcoin (BTC) as securities and highlighted the noncompliance of crypto companies.

XRP supporters allege Ethereum got free pass from SEC

XRP supporters have consistently claimed that former SEC Director William Hinman’s speech about Ethereum (ETH) was proof it had the support of the Commission.

According to them, the speech helped ETH gain widespread acceptance and increase in value. However, other cryptocurrencies — including XRP — struggled with a lack of regulatory clarity.

A pro-XRP individual, Mr. Huber, said it was ridiculous for anyone to consider Hinman’s speech pure coincidence. He added:

“Anyone who claims that this scandal is just an absurd conspiracy must believe Hinman’s policy and Clayton’s backing was a mere happenstance. “

Meanwhile, the SEC claims that Hinman’s speech was a personal opinion was soundly rejected by the XRP community, who allege that Ethereum insiders paid him.

Hoskinson has continually criticized this view, saying Ripple should build its case on merit rather than accusing the regulator of favoritism.

In December 2022, the Cardano founder described the XRP community as toxic and petty, saying he had never “encountered a community so willing to viciously attack a person who has not attacked them.”

"Coinbase CEO dismisses speculation that exchange plans to relocate from US","Armstrong stated that even though the US is falling behind in crypto regulations, Coinbase will always have a ""US presence.""","US-based exchange Coinbase’s CEO Brian Armstrong denied the suggestions that the exchange might carry its headquarters overseas to escape the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) interference, as reported by CNBC.

Armstrong criticized the US for falling behind in crypto regulations but stated that Coinbase would remain in the US, Armstrong said in an interview with CNBC in Dubai.

“Coinbase is not going to relocate overseas. We’re always going to have a U.S. presence …”

Moving overseas

The crypto community assumed that Coinbase was considering moving its headquarters to United Arab Emirates (UAE) after Coinbase’s VP of International and Business Development, Nana Murugesan stated the country had the potential to be a strategic hub for the exchange.

Murugesan shared his opinions on the UAE’s potential on May 8 without actually stating the expansion would be carrying headquarters. However, this came soon after Coinbase started having regulatory problems with the SEC, which led the community to think the exchange might relocate to avoid the legal confrontation.

The SEC issued a Wells notice to Coinbase on March 22, indicating that the SEC decided to imply enforcement action against the exchange. On April 24, Coinbase responded by filing a lawsuit to SEC, asking for clarification on crypto regulations.

US is falling behind

While denying relocation, Armstrong commented on the SEC’s recent attitude towards crypto and said that SEC’s negative tone might indicate that the SEC is not trying to regulate crypto but curtail it.

“The SEC is a bit of an outlier here. There’s kind of a lone crusade, if you will, with Gary Gensler, the chair there, and he has taken a more anti-crypto view for some reason.”

Armstrong said the lawsuits the SEC has been filing are “quite unhelpful” for the crypto industry in the US but an opportunity to get some regulatory clarity from the courts.

Comparing the US regulatory landscape to other countries, Armstrong stated:

“The U.S. is a little bit behind right now.

I would say we’re seeing more thoughtful approaches; for instance, in the EU, they’ve actually already passed comprehensive crypto legislation, the U.K. has been incredibly welcoming, and for us there, and that’s been a hub where we’ve decided to serve the U.K. market.”

"Canada launches CBDC consultation","The Bank of Canada's online public consultation on the Canadian CBDC will remain open until June 19, 2023.","The Bank of Canada launched an online public consultation on Canada’s Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) on May 8, according to the bank’s official website.

The consultation services are online and will remain open until June 19, 2023, as the announcement post noted.

Canadian digital dollar

The consultation platform will allow participants to speak their minds regarding the characteristics of the Canadian digital dollar.

Bank of Canada also noted that the country doesn’t need a digital dollar at the time being. The consultation was launched to be prepared for the future when a CBDC might be required.

Senior Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada, Carolyn Rogers, emphasized the purpose of the consultation and stated:

“As Canada’s central bank, we want to make sure everyone can always take part in our country’s economy. That means being ready for whatever the future holds,

“We want to hear from Canadians about what they value most in the design of a digital dollar. This will help us make design choices and ensure that it is secure, reliable and meets the needs of Canadians,”

The bank is primarily interested in learning about how Canadians would use the digital dollar, what security features are crucial, and what concerns citizens with regard to CBDC’s accessibility and privacy.

The announcement also noted that cash usage would remain the same even if the Canadian digital dollar is rolled out one day.

Canada on crypto

Canada has been collecting information on all branches related to crypto in recent years. The Bank of Canada conducted thorough research on crypto awareness, ownership, and quantum computing simulation last year and published its results in April 2022. The country also launched consultations on stablecoins, crypto in general, and CBDCs on November 2022 as well.

Despite all the collected data, Canada offers very little in terms of crypto regulations. In September 2022, Pierre Poilievre,  a Bitcoin (BTC) maximalist political, won the leadership of Canada’s Conservative Party. Even though this demonstrated the public stance against crypto, the country halted crypto adoption one month later, let alone expanding it.

In December 2022, Canada’s Securities and Administrators prevented crypto exchanges in the country from offering margin or leveraged trading services to Canadian users. In February 2023, Canada took regulations one step further and mandated crypto exchanges to a new set of rules, calling them to comply within 30 days.

"New law pushes around 400 crypto firms out of Estonia","Estonia faces a reputational risk due to money laundering scandals and crypto scams.","The number of registered crypto firms in Estonia has dropped by 80% after it enacted a new law to prevent money laundering.

The money laundering regulator in the country, Financial Intelligence Unit, published a report stating that the validity of 389 authorizations has expired, and there are only 100 active authorizations for virtual assets service providers.

The controversial law is the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act. Amendments to the law took effect on March 15, 2022.

Crypto exodus

Since then, 200 crypto firms in the country have voluntarily abandoned their authorizations. The FIU also revoked 189 due to non-compliance with the requirements of the amended Act.

The Director of the Financial Intelligence Unit, Matis Mäeker, said the documents submitted by firms that lost their authorization show “that the legislator’s response with regard to the amendments to the Act, and the supervision activities both before and after the amendments, have been relevant.”

Estonia is one of the most friendly countries for tech startups, including crypto firms. But it also faces a reputational risk due to money laundering scandals and crypto scams.

In its efforts to repair its reputation, it has tightened its money laundering laws and made it compulsory for crypto firms to re-apply for licenses. The regulator claimed it “saw situations that would surprise every supervisor” when renewing authorizations.

These include identical business plans by applicants, management board members who were unaware of their appointments, falsified CVs, and other issues. Besides that, many of the firms submitted their applications using the same legal or company services providers.

The regulator plans to continue reviewing authorizations but expects it to return to “normality in terms of supervision.”

"Vortex doubles mining capacity to combat inflation","Vortex Mining aims to meet the Bitcoin demand which is growing due to global inflation.","US-based Bitcoin (BTC) mining company Vortex Mining is doubling its mining capacity to combat global inflation.

Vortex said inflation has been increasing around the globe, which is creating a demand for BTC. Vortex Mining’s CEO, Todd Higley, commented on the increasing mining power and stated:

“We are very excited about the opportunities that bitcoin mining presents in this current economic climate. Our expansion plans reflect our confidence in the future of digital assets and our commitment to providing our shareholders with strong returns.”

Vortex Mining launched in August 2021 and currently holds less than 1 BTC in its public wallet.

For the nine-month period ending Nov. 30, 2022, the company reported net revenues of C$10,792 and a net loss of C$104,855.

While doubling its mining capacity, Vortex Mining also announced that it is committing to reducing its carbon footprint, and all the new expansion operations “will be done in an environmentally responsible manner.

Increasing fees

Vortex Mining’s desire to double its mining power resides in a gap it pinpointed between inflation and BTC demand. However, a recent CryptoSlate insight revealed that BTC miners have been earning more than the block reward.

Last time miners earned more than the block rewards was in 2017. On May 8, 2023, block 788695’s reward was 6.25 BTC. However, the block paid 6.701 BTC in fees, which equates to over $190,000 at the time of writing. The numbers also reveal that over 30% of miner revenue has come from the fees in the last 24 hours.

"Coinbase is considering UAE for its international hub","Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong praised United Arab Emirate's (UAE) progressive regulatory efforts in the crypto space.","US-based crypto exchange Coinbase is considering using the United Arab Emirates as the hub for its international service in the Middle East and other nearby regions.

In a May 8 tweet, Coinbase’s VP of International & Business Development, Nana Murugesan, said the country has the potential to be a strategic hub for the exchange.

The exchange’s CEO Brian Armstrong praised UAE’s progressive regulatory efforts in the crypto space. He said:

“[UAE has the] first dedicated crypto regulator in the world, a clear rule book published (!), business-friendly plus strong customer protections.” 

Why Coinbase wants to expand to UAE

In a May 8 blog post, Murugesan explained why the exchange was thinking of expanding to UAE.

According to the post, UAE has become the center of web3 innovation and a “key hub in the Middle East, Africa, and India as we explore crypto use cases that are relevant for the broader region.”

Due to its location, large expatriate population, state of the economy, other demographic qualities, and regulatory clarity on crypto — Coinbase believes it is an ideal country for investment.

“[UAE] serves as a particularly strategic bridge between Asia and Europe – two of our existing focus international regions to date.”

Murugesan wrote that Coinbase plans to register and license the Coinbase International Exchange in UAE and is working with the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) regulators to achieve this.

The exchange is also in discussion with Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) and seeks to be licensed by the regulatory agency. VARA is currently working on a retail framework for crypto trading activities in the country.

Recent regulatory troubles in the United States have forced Coinbase to spread its tentacles abroad. Earlier in the month, it launched an international derivatives exchange targeted at professional traders. The exchange is licensed by Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA).

"Bittrex files for US bankruptcy; will not halt global operations","The firm recently announced plans to halt U.S. operations after facing SEC charges.","Bittrex announced the bankruptcy of its U.S. entity on May 8.

The company said that it has decided to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in federal court in Delaware. It said that this decision only affects Bittrex Inc. and that its global platform, Bittrex Global, will continue to serve non-U.S. customers.

The company’s bankruptcy filing suggests that the firm has between $500 million and $1 billion in assets and between $500 million and $1 billion in liabilities. The filing additionally indicates that the firm has more than 100,000 creditors.

The company also said that U.S. customers who did not withdraw their funds from the platform when it closed at the end of April will regain access to their funds through proceedings, and that those funds remain “safe and secure.” 

SEC charges

The company previously received charges from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on April 17. Those charges alleged that Bittrex and its co-founder Bill Shihara failed to register its exchange platform with the regulator.

Later, on March 31, Bittrex said that it would halt U.S. operations by the end of April but did not suggest a bankruptcy filing at that time.

The exchange saw a fairly low trading volume of $5.6 million on May 8.

"Ripple pegs SEC lawsuit costs at $200M; plans Dubai expansion","CEO Brad Garlinghouse commented on his firm's attempts to find favorable regulation.","Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse discussed his company’s regulatory challenges at the Dubai Fintech Summit, CNBC reported on May 8.

There, Garlinghouse described the scale of Ripple’s ongoing legal conflict with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He said:

 “With the SEC … we will have spent $200 million defending ourselves against a lawsuit, which from its very beginning [people have said] doesn’t make a lot of sense.”

Garlinghouse added that this was the first time that he had shared the cost of the legal conflict publicly and argued that the U.S. is “definitely stuck” in terms of regulation.

In a separate tweet, Garlinghouse said that Ripple will expand to Dubai in response to the U.S. regulatory landscape. He said that 20% of Ripple’s customers are based in the MENA region, which has “clear regulatory regimes” and is becoming a global financial hub.

Ripple’s difficulties began in December 2020 when the SEC accused Ripple and its executives of violating securities regulations by selling XRP tokens.

Ripple is just one company that is attempting to fight the SEC. Crypto exchange Coinbase is also preparing to take on the SEC, as it has received a Wells notice from the regulator.

It is still unclear whether either challenge will succeed.

"Paxful reopening after month-long shutdown","The P2P crypto marketplace will restore market functionality in the coming days.","Paxful said May 8 that it will be reopening its services after a month-long shutdown.

The peer-to-peer crypto marketplace said that it will “gradually” restore market functions over the coming days. Paxful added on its website that its wallet remained functional during the shutdown and said that it provided users with access to alternative platforms.

Reports from Coindesk suggest that Paxful is now owned by a custodian who acts as a company director and “tie-breaker” alongside embattled co-founders Artur Schabeck and Ray Youssef. Coindesk obtained that information from Shabeck himself.

Strife between founders

Paxful first shut down operations on April 4, 2023. Though Paxful CEO Ray Youssef said in early private statements said the project team was “not sure if [Paxful] will come back,” Paxful itself suggested the halt was temporary on April 10.

Youssef later resigned from his position and contributed his personal company shares to a fund intended to compensate Paxful users.

The platform managed to restore access to 88% of funds by April 17. About $4.4 million remained frozen after that date due to a legal conflict between co-founders, as one party refused to pay compliance costs needed to unlock the funds.

Unlike many other companies that suspended user withdrawals over the course of 2022, Paxful has managed to recover without bankruptcy or restructuring proceedings.

"OpenAI CEO’s Worldcoin project launches wallet app","Worldcoin, founded by Sam Altman, is set to launch its WLD token this year.","Worldcoin, a cryptocurrency project co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, announced the launch of its cryptocurrency wallet on May 8.

Worldcoin wallet now, token later

The new wallet, titled “World App,” supports a beta version of Worldcoin (WLD) as well as third-party cryptocurrencies such as Wrapped Ethereum (WETH), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), USD Coin (USDC), and Maker’s DAI stablecoin (DAI).

Worldcoin itself is not currently in circulation but will be launched later this year. Users in eligible countries will be able to claim the token on a weekly or monthly basis. Users in the U.S. are not meant to hold the asset, WorldCoin said.

World App and Worldcoin are largely powered by the Ethereum blockchain and related technologies including account abstraction, ENS usernames, and Uniswap. The beta relies on Polygon while the final version will run on Ethereum rollups.

The project also relies on Ramp and MoonPay for fiat withdrawals and deposits.

Worldcoin focuses on AI, ID

Worldcoin attracted controversy beginning in 2021 due to its reliance on retina-scanning ID technology, which was frequently called “dystopian.”

The project addressed that concern today as it noted that World App integrates its World ID product, but on an optional basis. It said that the app does not “require any personal information” and said that users can delete their data instantly. It said that World ID keys are self-custodied, though users can back up those keys on cloud services.

Worldcoin also hinted at its artificial intelligence (AI) plans, noting that it aims to “empower individuals in the Age of AI” by providing “AI-funded UBI.”

Worldcoin is not directly related to OpenAI beyond the fact that Sam Altman has been involved in both firms. Altman has also held other roles in the tech industry, including various positions at the startup accelerator YCombinator between 2011 and 2019.

"Cardano’s Hoskinson says SEC actions debunk Ripple lawsuit conspiracy theory","XRP supporters have claimed that former SEC Director William Hinman's speech about Ethereum was proof it had the support of the regulator.","Cardano (ADA) founder Charles Hoskinson believes the recent anti-crypto moves by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) take away the legitimacy of the conspiracy theories being propagated regarding the legal tussle between the regulator and Ripple.

In a May 8 tweet, Hoskinson noted that the theory popularized by XRP holders that the SEC was antagonizing XRP because of Ethereum insider bribes was “conspiracy,” adding that recent regulatory actions against the crypto industry were proof of this being an “accurate” assessment.

“I said the concept that the entire SEC is united against ripple by bribes from ethereum insiders is a conspiracy. Given that now Coinbase, Kraken, Bittrex, Tron, and dozens of others have been hit, it seems more accurate then ever”

While the SEC v Ripple case is still ongoing, SEC chair Gary Gensler has described all digital assets except Bitcoin (BTC) as securities and highlighted the noncompliance of crypto companies.

XRP supporters allege Ethereum got free pass from SEC

XRP supporters have consistently claimed that former SEC Director William Hinman’s speech about Ethereum (ETH) was proof it had the support of the Commission.

According to them, the speech helped ETH gain widespread acceptance and increase in value. However, other cryptocurrencies — including XRP — struggled with a lack of regulatory clarity.

A pro-XRP individual, Mr. Huber, said it was ridiculous for anyone to consider Hinman’s speech pure coincidence. He added:

“Anyone who claims that this scandal is just an absurd conspiracy must believe Hinman’s policy and Clayton’s backing was a mere happenstance. “

Meanwhile, the SEC claims that Hinman’s speech was a personal opinion was soundly rejected by the XRP community, who allege that Ethereum insiders paid him.

Hoskinson has continually criticized this view, saying Ripple should build its case on merit rather than accusing the regulator of favoritism.

In December 2022, the Cardano founder described the XRP community as toxic and petty, saying he had never “encountered a community so willing to viciously attack a person who has not attacked them.”

"Coinbase CEO dismisses speculation that exchange plans to relocate from US","Armstrong stated that even though the US is falling behind in crypto regulations, Coinbase will always have a ""US presence.""","US-based exchange Coinbase’s CEO Brian Armstrong denied the suggestions that the exchange might carry its headquarters overseas to escape the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) interference, as reported by CNBC.

Armstrong criticized the US for falling behind in crypto regulations but stated that Coinbase would remain in the US, Armstrong said in an interview with CNBC in Dubai.

“Coinbase is not going to relocate overseas. We’re always going to have a U.S. presence …”

Moving overseas

The crypto community assumed that Coinbase was considering moving its headquarters to United Arab Emirates (UAE) after Coinbase’s VP of International and Business Development, Nana Murugesan stated the country had the potential to be a strategic hub for the exchange.

Murugesan shared his opinions on the UAE’s potential on May 8 without actually stating the expansion would be carrying headquarters. However, this came soon after Coinbase started having regulatory problems with the SEC, which led the community to think the exchange might relocate to avoid the legal confrontation.

The SEC issued a Wells notice to Coinbase on March 22, indicating that the SEC decided to imply enforcement action against the exchange. On April 24, Coinbase responded by filing a lawsuit to SEC, asking for clarification on crypto regulations.

US is falling behind

While denying relocation, Armstrong commented on the SEC’s recent attitude towards crypto and said that SEC’s negative tone might indicate that the SEC is not trying to regulate crypto but curtail it.

“The SEC is a bit of an outlier here. There’s kind of a lone crusade, if you will, with Gary Gensler, the chair there, and he has taken a more anti-crypto view for some reason.”

"Canada launches CBDC consultation","The Bank of Canada's online public consultation on the Canadian CBDC will remain open until June 19, 2023.","The Bank of Canada launched an online public consultation on Canada’s Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) on May 8, according to the bank’s official website.

The consultation services are online and will remain open until June 19, 2023, as the announcement post noted.

Canadian digital dollar

The consultation platform will allow participants to speak their minds regarding the characteristics of the Canadian digital dollar.

Bank of Canada also noted that the country doesn’t need a digital dollar at the time being. The consultation was launched to be prepared for the future when a CBDC might be required.

Senior Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada, Carolyn Rogers, emphasized the purpose of the consultation and stated:

“As Canada’s central bank, we want to make sure everyone can always take part in our country’s economy. That means being ready for whatever the future holds,

“We want to hear from Canadians about what they value most in the design of a digital dollar. This will help us make design choices and ensure that it is secure, reliable and meets the needs of Canadians,”

The bank is primarily interested in learning about how Canadians would use the digital dollar, what security features are crucial, and what concerns citizens with regard to CBDC’s accessibility and privacy.

The announcement also noted that cash usage would remain the same even if the Canadian digital dollar is rolled out one day.

Canada on crypto

Canada has been collecting information on all branches related to crypto in recent years. The Bank of Canada conducted thorough research on crypto awareness, ownership, and quantum computing simulation last year and published its results in April 2022. The country also launched consultations on stablecoins, crypto in general, and CBDCs on November 2022 as well.

Despite all the collected data, Canada offers very little in terms of crypto regulations. In September 2022, Pierre Poilievre,  a Bitcoin (BTC) maximalist political, won the leadership of Canada’s Conservative Party. Even though this demonstrated the public stance against crypto, the country halted crypto adoption one month later, let alone expanding it.

In December 2022, Canada’s Securities and Administrators prevented crypto exchanges in the country from offering margin or leveraged trading services to Canadian users. In February 2023, Canada took regulations one step further and mandated crypto exchanges to a new set of rules, calling them to comply within 30 days.

"New law pushes around 400 crypto firms out of Estonia","Estonia faces a reputational risk due to money laundering scandals and crypto scams.","The number of registered crypto firms in Estonia has dropped by 80% after it enacted a new law to prevent money laundering.

The money laundering regulator in the country, Financial Intelligence Unit, published a report stating that the validity of 389 authorizations has expired, and there are only 100 active authorizations for virtual assets service providers.

The controversial law is the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act. Amendments to the law took effect on March 15, 2022.

Crypto exodus

Since then, 200 crypto firms in the country have voluntarily abandoned their authorizations. The FIU also revoked 189 due to non-compliance with the requirements of the amended Act.

The Director of the Financial Intelligence Unit, Matis Mäeker, said the documents submitted by firms that lost their authorization show “that the legislator’s response with regard to the amendments to the Act, and the supervision activities both before and after the amendments, have been relevant.”

Estonia is one of the most friendly countries for tech startups, including crypto firms. But it also faces a reputational risk due to money laundering scandals and crypto scams.

In its efforts to repair its reputation, it has tightened its money laundering laws and made it compulsory for crypto firms to re-apply for licenses. The regulator claimed it “saw situations that would surprise every supervisor” when renewing authorizations.

These include identical business plans by applicants, management board members who were unaware of their appointments, falsified CVs, and other issues. Besides that, many of the firms submitted their applications using the same legal or company services providers.

The regulator plans to continue reviewing authorizations but expects it to return to “normality in terms of supervision.”

"Vortex doubles mining capacity to combat inflation","Vortex Mining aims to meet the Bitcoin demand which is growing due to global inflation.","US-based Bitcoin (BTC) mining company Vortex Mining is doubling its mining capacity to combat global inflation.

Vortex said inflation has been increasing around the globe, which is creating a demand for BTC. Vortex Mining’s CEO, Todd Higley, commented on the increasing mining power and stated:

“We are very excited about the opportunities that bitcoin mining presents in this current economic climate. Our expansion plans reflect our confidence in the future of digital assets and our commitment to providing our shareholders with strong returns.”

Vortex Mining launched in August 2021 and currently holds less than 1 BTC in its public wallet.

For the nine-month period ending Nov. 30, 2022, the company reported net revenues of C$10,792 and a net loss of C$104,855.

While doubling its mining capacity, Vortex Mining also announced that it is committing to reducing its carbon footprint, and all the new expansion operations “will be done in an environmentally responsible manner.

Increasing fees

Vortex Mining’s desire to double its mining power resides in a gap it pinpointed between inflation and BTC demand. However, a recent CryptoSlate insight revealed that BTC miners have been earning more than the block reward.

Last time miners earned more than the block rewards was in 2017. On May 8, 2023, block 788695’s reward was 6.25 BTC. However, the block paid 6.701 BTC in fees, which equates to over $190,000 at the time of writing. The numbers also reveal that over 30% of miner revenue has come from the fees in the last 24 hours.

"Coinbase is considering UAE for its international hub","Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong praised United Arab Emirate's (UAE) progressive regulatory efforts in the crypto space.","US-based crypto exchange Coinbase is considering using the United Arab Emirates as the hub for its international service in the Middle East and other nearby regions.

In a May 8 tweet, Coinbase’s VP of International & Business Development, Nana Murugesan, said the country has the potential to be a strategic hub for the exchange.

The exchange’s CEO Brian Armstrong praised UAE’s progressive regulatory efforts in the crypto space. He said:

“[UAE has the] first dedicated crypto regulator in the world, a clear rule book published (!), business-friendly plus strong customer protections.” 

Why Coinbase wants to expand to UAE

In a May 8 blog post, Murugesan explained why the exchange was thinking of expanding to UAE.

According to the post, UAE has become the center of web3 innovation and a “key hub in the Middle East, Africa, and India as we explore crypto use cases that are relevant for the broader region.”

Due to its location, large expatriate population, state of the economy, other demographic qualities, and regulatory clarity on crypto — Coinbase believes it is an ideal country for investment.

“[UAE] serves as a particularly strategic bridge between Asia and Europe – two of our existing focus international regions to date.”

Murugesan wrote that Coinbase plans to register and license the Coinbase International Exchange in UAE and is working with the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) regulators to achieve this.

The exchange is also in discussion with Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) and seeks to be licensed by the regulatory agency. VARA is currently working on a retail framework for crypto trading activities in the country.

Recent regulatory troubles in the United States have forced Coinbase to spread its tentacles abroad. Earlier in the month, it launched an international derivatives exchange targeted at professional traders. The exchange is licensed by Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA).

"Binance says Bitcoin ‘outflows’ are internal wallet movements","Binance’s reported Bitcoin outflows caused concerns among crypto community members who were worried about its balance.","Crypto exchange Binance has clarified that the large volume of Bitcoin (BTC) outflows most data aggregators reported was false.

According to a May 8 tweet, the exchange said the reported “outflows” were internal movements between its hot and cold wallets due to its address adjustments.

In the last 24 hours, Coinglass data showed that Binance experienced outflows of around 180,000 BTC.

This was further corroborated by CryptoQuant data that showed the exchange saw outflows of nearly 190,000 BTC in the last two days.

These reported outflows caused concerns among several crypto community members who expressed worry about the exchange’s balance.

However, CryptoQuant head of research Julio Moreno reported that the “two transactions of 117,000 and 40,000 Bitcoin” were “sent to newly created change addresses that belong to Binance.”

Moreno added outflows from Binance were likely around 10,100.

A market analyst at Bitcoin Layer Joe Consorti noted that “Binance has actually NOT seen a huge drawdown in its Bitcoin balance.”

According to Consorti, the issues were caused by improperly labeled wallets by the different service providers — causing regular wallet shuffling to look like deposit outflows. He added:

“In reality, the BTC outflows are far more muted, only -11,000 over the last week.”

Meanwhile, Binance said DeFiLlama data showed accurate information about its wallet movement. According to the data, the exchange has Bitcoin worth $16.9 billion in the exchange, and the total value of assets on the platform is worth $65.61 billion.

Earlier today, Binance said it was working on enabling support for Bitcoin lightning network due to the network congestion issues that forced it to pause withdrawals twice in 24 hours.

"Binance working to enable Bitcoin lightning network","Blockchain analytical firm Glassnode reported that Bitcoin was ""experiencing extremely high demand for blockspace.""","Binance is working to enable Bitcoin (BTC) lightning network withdrawals for its users after experiencing issues due to the volume of pending transactions.

In a May 8 Twitter thread, the exchange explained that it had to temporarily pause BTC withdrawals due to the large volume of pending transactions. It continued that there were large volumes of BTC withdrawal transactions from the exchange that were yet to be processed.

According to Binance, the recent surge in BTC gas fees caused this failure. However, it said it would replace pending transactions with higher fees so mining pools could process them.

The exchange eventually reopened BTC withdrawals after about 2 hours, saying that it had increased the transaction fees.

“To prevent a similar recurrence in the future, our fees have been adjusted. We will continue to monitor on-chain activity and adjust accordingly if needed,” it added.

Meanwhile, this is not the first time Binance has paused BTC withdrawals. The exchange had earlier paused withdrawals on May 7 for about one hour. At the time, it cited network congestion issues.

There have also been instances where Binance paused withdrawals and deposits for other digital assets due to technical issues on the exchange. In December 2022, the exchange paused USDC withdrawals because the exchange was conducting a token swap involving the Circle-backed stablecoin.

BTC network fees surge

Bitcoin transaction fees have risen significantly in the last few months and are currently around $10 after rising to as high as $26 a few hours ago. There are also over 424,000 unconfirmed transactions on the network as of press time.

While $10 might seem low, it is relatively high, given that Bitcoin transaction fees were around $1 about six months ago. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said the rise in transaction fees is a sign of a bull market.

Blockchain analytical firm Glassnode reported that the network was “experiencing extremely high demand for blockspace driven by BRC-20 tokens, utilizing text-based inscriptions, and ordinals.”

Source: Glassnode

Glassnode added that the average fee paid per block has risen to 2.9 BTC — nearly as high as past bull peaks.

"Op-ed: Is blockchain quickly becoming the solution for ESG?","Fly Air Inc CEO Stuart Bullard shares insights on how blockchain technology can revolutionize carbon offsets, ESG reporting, and capital allocation for a sustainable future.","The following is a guest post by Fly Air Inc CEO Stuart Bullard.

ESG is in the spotlight, and executives at major corporations are starting to take sustainability seriously. Corporations understand that they must measure, report, and manage their emissions efficiently. Some have even set their net-zero commitments, creating many challenges to overcome.

Carbon offsets or carbon credits are permits. Owners can emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases. Bank of America estimates that carbon offsets to ensure companies meet these sustainability commitments must grow 30 to 50 times. Some posit the true number is closer to 300 times.

It won’t be inexpensive. Microsoft has annual emissions of about 16 million tonnes. Based on what a carbon offset costs now, which is between $2-$20, it could cost Microsoft tens or hundreds of millions to comply.

Capital Allocation And Regulation

Needless to say, corporations face significant challenges in meeting both these disclosure requirements and managing their exposure to these issues. Blockchain could aid in two general categories: capital allocation and regulation.

Many who direct capital to the energy industry want to shift away from fossil fuel to cleantech. The fossil fuel sector has a legacy of detailed and well-known parameters that come into play–credit exposure, types of risk, capital allocations, etc. Banks, financial institutions, and investors are familiar with that process, in which spreadsheets can calculate the exposure risk many decades ahead.

The clean tech industry doesn’t have that history nor the same degree of models. On the one hand, it’s an advantage for those companies without a real revenue stream because they receive capital from governments that don’t look at credit exposure. They are most concerned with allocated capital into preferred industries, products, and services. On the other hand, private enterprises wouldn’t touch these companies due to their lack of profit.

Blockchain can help private capital to enter into sustainability markets, particularly when it comes to pricing. Europe is currently working to create pricing standards, allowing private capital to examine models to determine how to allocate capital. Blockchain’s ability to govern the provenance of a carbon emission–where it took place, if it can be resold, who are the governing bodies, etc.–assists with associated risks around legal ownership and more. There will be a variety of pricing for carbon emissions, and the market will be constantly changing. Blockchain can keep track.

Many companies worldwide are now faced with requirements stipulating they must report emissions. They are being asked to take measurements along the entire hydrocarbon value chain to get the numbers required by disclosures. (UNICEF, for instance, has proposed track and trace capabilities alongside the entire value chain for specific industries)

Blockchain is a good candidate because it can track pieces of data as they change provenance, and is also immutable, which energy companies prefer. ESG can apply the same methodology to unleash the potential of increased transparency alongside the value chain to better report on ESG. This makes the jobs of regulators easier, too.

A Logical Application For Blockchain

The energy industry players have been around for a long time. And their systems and processes have been around for 30-40 years. As companies adopt new carbon offsets and credit permits in the trading world, they’ll work in a technological environment dating back to the seventies.

Let’s consider how one gets a price for commodities such as co2 emissions. It behaves similarly to the traditional commodity markets, creating a bearer document that can be exchanged for a commodity. Blockchain can improve the industry with smart contracts, smart invoicing, pricing clarity, validation, etc.

It can also increase efficiency, making business processes quicker and smarter, leading to adoption and enabling and improving sustainability. By automating smart contracts on a secure and immutable blockchain, entities along a supply chain can be incentivized to contribute to sustainability goals.

There’s no time for delay. One can already buy credits today from a farmer’s field in Saskatchewan or the rainforest in Brazil, and blockchain will promote the overall stability of the system while providing a protocol that is accessible and testable. Blockchain can standardize global markets and create a transparent and immutable system of carbon credits.

"Op-ed: Consensus algorithms can be engineered to unlock blockchain for business","Connecting traditional businesses with blockchain technology requires merging the pBFT consensus algorithm and asynchronous model to ensure compliance, data privacy, and scalable enterprise solutions.","The following is a guest post by Venom Foundation CTO Christopher Louis Tsu.

Connecting blockchain to traditional businesses is not a simple process. So-called non-crypto industries, particularly finance, banking and insurance, are markedly disconnected because each possesses a general modus operandi that does not neatly fit into current blockchain solutions.

Concerns in these fields abound over security, compliance and cloud computing and how this fits into implementing on-chain technology. Here are two disjointed worlds, which can be brought together through fintech and blockchain innovations. But this is not a straightforward process.

The truth is it’s hard to create a layer one solution, a blockchain, which adheres to the principles of decentralization and transparency without sacrificing the important aspects of data privacy and regulatory compliance.

Those working to build the blockchain-based future need to pay close attention to these latter features. In the absence of proper data protocols, traditional finance executives are unlikely to adopt the technology — nor will the tangentially related banking and insurance industries — while careful consideration must be taken to avoid the ire of lawmakers.

The tempting solution for hungry innovators is to abandon fundamental crypto principles. In the process, they would lose sight of what makes the technology so robust and inherently scalable. But it does not have to be this way.

Overcoming the Challenges

Moderating the hype around blockchain is important to create sustainable, versatile and pertinent solutions to the non-crypto industries which can actually be improved with the technology. Not all sectors need blockchain; this article mentions finance and banking as potential leaders of adoption, because these are examples where applications make a lot of sense.

Increased security and efficiency is a compelling case for the finance sector with the added benefit of more transparent governance, a lower risk of fraud, and reduction of counterparty risk. Insurance companies will look at smart contracts in order to streamline claims processes and enjoy stronger security. Meanwhile, clearance and settlement can be much cheaper and faster using distributed ledgers. Evidently tremendous amounts of money can be saved by large companies handling enormous volumes of capital flow.

As always, implementation presents challenges to innovators. But we can ascertain the major prerequisites for an adoptable blockchain network: it needs to offer complete data privacy and be compliant with legislation that hasn’t even been written and relevant existing legal structures. Businesses will only work with an unfailingly compliant solution and not a single major, public blockchain currently meets these standards. However, adroit engineering of new solutions promises much.

The key lies in iterative advances in technology as witnessed over the past two decades. A blockchain can work in enterprise without compromise, but it needs to be configured in a novel way.

The choice of consensus algorithm carries, of course, vital importance. Yet the steps taken to implement this into a blockchain and how the system is engineered are just as salient. The blockchain trilemma, and the aforementioned prerequisites for an enterprise blockchain, cannot be solved satisfactorily without a shrewdly designed system that makes clever use of multiple technologies.

Consensus is an ever-growing field of research pertaining to blockchain; there is no surprise in technical quarters that hundreds of layer one solutions are being prepared for market, in some cases with wildly different approaches.

One compelling technical solution lies in the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT) consensus algorithm, a sustainability-led shift from Proof of Work. Yet the heavy lifting cannot be done by pBFT alone. If it could, companies would have done so already.

To unlock the immense potential of a blockchain with pBFT one may look towards a technology still heavily used in Web2 which, when integrated properly, provides enormous upside for businesses not yet convinced by existing chains.

Merging Two Evolution Cycles

pBFT proves to be a highly streamlined method for reaching consensus in a distributed environment while maintaining bulletproof robustness, demonstrable in huge ecosystems: examples include the Cosmos Blockchains on Tendermint consensus, Hyperledger and many others. There is no doubt that static and dynamic sharding are among the fastest approaches to consensus in production, which pBFT does.

But what we haven’t seen often is pBFT implemented with an asynchronous model. This is the golden ticket to both satisfying traditional enterprise needs and retaining ironclad crypto security, while leaving the door wide open for decentralized applications.

pBFT has evolved as an energy efficient way of smart contract execution in a trustless decentralized environment, at the same time the asynchronous model has grown to be favored by traditional enterprise architects, such as Kafka and Akka, as an efficient way to parallelize execution in a clustered environment.

Asynchronous stateless communication, as opposed to stateful, is generally used by all traditional clustered databases, all distributed queues and even many app caches. Stateless is far less resource intensive because the system does not need to track session details and multiple links, and the asynchronous model itself ensures transaction throughput can remain high as nodes do not need to wait for other nodes to receive their messages.

In a stateless system, no information needs to be stored nor does it necessitate a response, tracking or the resending of requests in the absence of a response. Consider this protocol as a highly streamlined engine which eliminates bandwidth-hogging processes wherever possible.

Now when we talk of parallelizing execution, we can often take this to mean dynamic and static sharding — it’s the most popular method, especially within a blockchain context. Splitting and storing a dataset across multiplicitous databases and adding more machines allows vast volumes of data to be stored effectively to scale to manage ever-increasing data flows and rapid traffic growth.

A combination of pBFT and the asynchronous model shows a structure’s markings to create a blockchain that does the job rapidly, at scale, and to the high requirements of lawmakers and business leaders.

The Emerging Role of pBFT in Enterprise

pBFT is a consensus algorithm designed in the 1990s to solve problems in many available Byzantine Fault Tolerance solutions. Now it seems tailor-made for blockchain applications in non-crypto businesses, apt for those involving a consortium of enterprise organizations because each organization can represent a node on the network — with each of these nodes programmed to have clusters of instances and load balancers behind the node’s endpoint.

This means computational power can be massively scaled without compromising on a rapid response time. High levels of security are ensured without sacrificing an incredibly cost-effective communication overhead.

With a substantial majority required to confirm transactions, the system is set up to work even in situations where validators crash or maliciously broadcast incorrect information. And the crucial function of nodes here is underlaid by verification. Each network user must verify their identity so such a system passes KYC with flying colors.

pBFT is, in essence, designed to ensure robust data consistency with no danger of data loss in the event several nodes go offline or hardware failure occurs.

Yet data can be protected and kept private without compromising the transparency of transactions to those allowed access; any node without the user’s private key cannot forge its identity or the message’s signature. The system is inherently reliable because the cost of attempting such a forgery is astronomical.

Moreover, pBFT allows a distributed system to reach consensus despite an event where several nodes act to subvert the system. Every node performs computations for verifiability, security, and peace due to the inbuilt usage of cryptographic algorithms such as signature, signature verification, and hash.

The green light from lawmakers is plausible because imminent regulations can be considered, especially regarding the potential for fraud and money laundering. Traditional businesses will meanwhile need their operations to remain compliant without disposing of proper data protection — necessary in the EU with GDPR, but further desirable for many jurisdictions, businesses, and customers — and with no loss of data privacy.

Anti Money Laundering (AML), standard banking transactions, and clearing and settlement, once made possible on a blockchain without drawbacks or legal issues, could lead to a wave of adoption in finance and banking as a much better solution than those being used already.

And in terms of economic logic, a strong case for the asynchronous model here is wrapped in the parallelization aspect. While major blockchains grapple with the issue of scaling to handle high volumes of traffic, here lies an inbuilt sharding protocol that exponentially increases the limit without increasing costs.

A Feasible Path to Adoption

Common logic dictates companies will adopt a blockchain with a reliably high network speed and low transaction fees. Costs do come secondary to necessities regarding compliance and data protection, but it forms a crucial hinge upon which widespread adoption can happen. pBFT combined with an asynchronous model promises low fees, high speed and reliability, and data redundancy if implemented.

Using an asynchronous model bolsters network security as a limited number of nodes can behave unpredictably or arbitrarily without compromising the system’s safety. pBFT tolerates byzantine faults in an asynchronous network and uses the view-change protocol to guarantee liveness — which means the client finally receives the correct replies to their requests. This works exceptionally well in an asynchronous environment such as the Internet.

With pBFT ensuring a network attack is highly improbable. With the confidence that delays to consensus will not be indefinite, an asynchronous stateless model can create a blockchain that serves both the traditional and crypto worlds.

Enterprise demands are not broadly changing. Therefore, innovators must deliver a blockchain that meets these demands. Achieving this would open the gates to adoption.

"Britain’s fourth largest newspaper offers free King Charles coronation NFTs","The Evening Standard is allowing Nifty Gateway users to mint their own cryptocollectible featuring the famous St. Edwards Crown.","The Evening Standard said on May 5 that it is releasing a series of free non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to commemorate the coronation of King Charles.

NFT features animated St. Edward’s Crown

The collectible NFT includes an animated copy of “The Oath” by Trevor Jones. This painting features St. Edward’s Crown, the centerpiece of the UK’s Crown Jewels.

The non-fungible token is currently available for free on the Nifty Gateway marketplace. Users only need to provide an email address to register and collect the item, though it is unclear whether users need to pay a  transaction fee to receive the item.

The NFT is “open edition,” meaning that there is no limit on the number of NFTs that can be minted. Users have minted 9,200 copies of the NFT as of 11:30 p.m. UTC on May 5.

Though there is no limit on the number of minted NFTs, there is a time limit. Users can only mint the token between Thursday, May 4 and Sunday, May 7.

The event represents a move into crypto from a major UK company. The Evening Standard was the UK’s fourth largest daily paper by circulation in 2020 following The Metro, The Sun, and The Daily Mail. It circulated over 314,000 papers per day in January 2023.

The state of crypto in Britain

The UK government previously announced its desire for the country to become a “crypto hub” in April 2022. This originally included plans for the Royal Mint to issue its own NFT, though those plans were ultimately dropped in March 2023.

The UK has more recently announced plans to create post-Brexit crypto regulation and currently has strict regulations from The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The FCA has  recently cracked down on unregistered crypto ATMs and non-compliant advertising, and the agency has even targeted specific crypto companies such as Binance.

Statista suggests that the UK crypto industry could see $1.89 billion in revenue in 2023.

"Google could lose the AI race, leaked doc says","A Google engineer suggested that his company should work with the open-source community — something that it has done with browsers, Android, and crypto.","A senior Google engineer said that both OpenAI and his own company could lose AI development race, as seen in an internal document leaked on May 4.

Google, OpenAI could lose against open-source

Google has discussed its AI plans in an earnings call and has publicly begun to offer a chatbot called Bard. However, the firm has countless other AI research efforts underway internally, and now, an engineer has suggested that those efforts may not be enough.

The anonymous Google engineer wrote:

“The uncomfortable truth is … we aren’t positioned to win this arms race and neither is OpenAI. While we’ve been squabbling, a third faction has been quietly eating our lunch.”

That third faction, the anonymous engineer said, is the open-source community, which is currently “lapping” Google and is open to anyone with a “beefy laptop.”

The engineer said that the open-source community has already solved problems that Google and other closed developers struggle with. He cited Meta’s LLaMA as the open-source community’s first “really capable foundation model.” Despite its infancy, the community began to improve upon LLaMA within days of its leak on March 3.

The engineer also commented on Google’s competition with ChatGPT creator OpenAI. He argued that although OpenAI has recruited researchers from Google, it faces the same challenges that Google does and will eventually be “eclipsed” by open source.

Google should work with open-source

The engineer suggested that competing directly with open source is a “losing proposition,” noting that users will not pay for restricted models when free and unrestricted models exist.

As such, he said that Google should cooperate with the open-source community. He noted that Google has already done this with other open-source products, such as its Chrome web browser and its mobile operating system, Android.

Google’s cloud division has also worked extensively with numerous open-source blockchain projects — including Polygon, Solana, and Tezos, among others.

"Binance probed by DOJ over potential Russian sanctions violations","The company and its executive have not been charged with wrongdoing.","The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is looking into possible violations of Russian sanctions by Binance, Bloomberg reported May 5.

Specifically, the DOJ’s national security division intends to determine whether Binance or its executives circumvented sanctions around Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Numerous sanctions of this type were imposed beginning in early 2022, and Binance seemingly responded by limiting its services to Russia in April 2022.

The investigation is being conducted in parallel with another ongoing inquiry from the DOJ’s criminal vision, according to Bloomberg’s sources.

Binance and its executives have not yet been accused of wrongdoing, and the probe has not been officially announced or previously reported, Bloomberg said. Instead, it obtained its information from five individuals with knowledge of the matter.

Bloomberg’s sources said that Binance has previously engaged with the DOJ to resolve other issues around compliance, particularly those concerning Iranian sanctions evasion.

Incidentally, Senator Elizabeth Warren addressed Binance’s role in handling cryptocurrency from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on May 4.

Elsewhere, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed charges against Binance on March 27, alleging Binance allowed users to illegally access commodities.

"Binance says Bitcoin ‘outflows’ are internal wallet movements","Binance’s reported Bitcoin outflows caused concerns among crypto community members who were worried about its balance.","Crypto exchange Binance has clarified that the large volume of Bitcoin (BTC) outflows most data aggregators reported was false.

According to a May 8 tweet, the exchange said the reported “outflows” were internal movements between its hot and cold wallets due to its address adjustments.

In the last 24 hours, Coinglass data showed that Binance experienced outflows of around 180,000 BTC.

This was further corroborated by CryptoQuant data that showed the exchange saw outflows of nearly 190,000 BTC in the last two days.

These reported outflows caused concerns among several crypto community members who expressed worry about the exchange’s balance.

However, CryptoQuant head of research Julio Moreno reported that the “two transactions of 117,000 and 40,000 Bitcoin” were “sent to newly created change addresses that belong to Binance.”

Moreno added outflows from Binance were likely around 10,100.

A market analyst at Bitcoin Layer Joe Consorti noted that “Binance has actually NOT seen a huge drawdown in its Bitcoin balance.”

According to Consorti, the issues were caused by improperly labeled wallets by the different service providers — causing regular wallet shuffling to look like deposit outflows. He added:

“In reality, the BTC outflows are far more muted, only -11,000 over the last week.”

Meanwhile, Binance said DeFiLlama data showed accurate information about its wallet movement. According to the data, the exchange has Bitcoin worth $16.9 billion in the exchange, and the total value of assets on the platform is worth $65.61 billion.

Earlier today, Binance said it was working on enabling support for Bitcoin lightning network due to the network congestion issues that forced it to pause withdrawals twice in 24 hours.

"Binance working to enable Bitcoin lightning network","Blockchain analytical firm Glassnode reported that Bitcoin was ""experiencing extremely high demand for blockspace.""","Binance is working to enable Bitcoin (BTC) lightning network withdrawals for its users after experiencing issues due to the volume of pending transactions.

In a May 8 Twitter thread, the exchange explained that it had to temporarily pause BTC withdrawals due to the large volume of pending transactions. It continued that there were large volumes of BTC withdrawal transactions from the exchange that were yet to be processed.

According to Binance, the recent surge in BTC gas fees caused this failure. However, it said it would replace pending transactions with higher fees so mining pools could process them.

The exchange eventually reopened BTC withdrawals after about 2 hours, saying that it had increased the transaction fees.

“To prevent a similar recurrence in the future, our fees have been adjusted. We will continue to monitor on-chain activity and adjust accordingly if needed,” it added.

Meanwhile, this is not the first time Binance has paused BTC withdrawals. The exchange had earlier paused withdrawals on May 7 for about one hour. At the time, it cited network congestion issues.

There have also been instances where Binance paused withdrawals and deposits for other digital assets due to technical issues on the exchange. In December 2022, the exchange paused USDC withdrawals because the exchange was conducting a token swap involving the Circle-backed stablecoin.

BTC network fees surge

Bitcoin transaction fees have risen significantly in the last few months and are currently around $10 after rising to as high as $26 a few hours ago. There are also over 424,000 unconfirmed transactions on the network as of press time.

While $10 might seem low, it is relatively high, given that Bitcoin transaction fees were around $1 about six months ago. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said the rise in transaction fees is a sign of a bull market.

Blockchain analytical firm Glassnode reported that the network was “experiencing extremely high demand for blockspace driven by BRC-20 tokens, utilizing text-based inscriptions, and ordinals.”

Source: Glassnode

Glassnode added that the average fee paid per block has risen to 2.9 BTC — nearly as high as past bull peaks.

"Op-ed: Is blockchain quickly becoming the solution for ESG?","Fly Air Inc CEO Stuart Bullard shares insights on how blockchain technology can revolutionize carbon offsets, ESG reporting, and capital allocation for a sustainable future.","The following is a guest post by Fly Air Inc CEO Stuart Bullard.

ESG is in the spotlight, and executives at major corporations are starting to take sustainability seriously. Corporations understand that they must measure, report, and manage their emissions efficiently. Some have even set their net-zero commitments, creating many challenges to overcome.

Carbon offsets or carbon credits are permits. Owners can emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases. Bank of America estimates that carbon offsets to ensure companies meet these sustainability commitments must grow 30 to 50 times. Some posit the true number is closer to 300 times.

It won’t be inexpensive. Microsoft has annual emissions of about 16 million tonnes. Based on what a carbon offset costs now, which is between $2-$20, it could cost Microsoft tens or hundreds of millions to comply.

Capital Allocation And Regulation

Needless to say, corporations face significant challenges in meeting both these disclosure requirements and managing their exposure to these issues. Blockchain could aid in two general categories: capital allocation and regulation.

Many who direct capital to the energy industry want to shift away from fossil fuel to cleantech. The fossil fuel sector has a legacy of detailed and well-known parameters that come into play–credit exposure, types of risk, capital allocations, etc. Banks, financial institutions, and investors are familiar with that process, in which spreadsheets can calculate the exposure risk many decades ahead.

The clean tech industry doesn’t have that history nor the same degree of models. On the one hand, it’s an advantage for those companies without a real revenue stream because they receive capital from governments that don’t look at credit exposure. They are most concerned with allocated capital into preferred industries, products, and services. On the other hand, private enterprises wouldn’t touch these companies due to their lack of profit.

Blockchain can help private capital to enter into sustainability markets, particularly when it comes to pricing. Europe is currently working to create pricing standards, allowing private capital to examine models to determine how to allocate capital. Blockchain’s ability to govern the provenance of a carbon emission–where it took place, if it can be resold, who are the governing bodies, etc.–assists with associated risks around legal ownership and more. There will be a variety of pricing for carbon emissions, and the market will be constantly changing. Blockchain can keep track.

Many companies worldwide are now faced with requirements stipulating they must report emissions. They are being asked to take measurements along the entire hydrocarbon value chain to get the numbers required by disclosures. (UNICEF, for instance, has proposed track and trace capabilities alongside the entire value chain for specific industries)

Blockchain is a good candidate because it can track pieces of data as they change provenance, and is also immutable, which energy companies prefer. ESG can apply the same methodology to unleash the potential of increased transparency alongside the value chain to better report on ESG. This makes the jobs of regulators easier, too.

A Logical Application For Blockchain

The energy industry players have been around for a long time. And their systems and processes have been around for 30-40 years. As companies adopt new carbon offsets and credit permits in the trading world, they’ll work in a technological environment dating back to the seventies.

Let’s consider how one gets a price for commodities such as co2 emissions. It behaves similarly to the traditional commodity markets, creating a bearer document that can be exchanged for a commodity. Blockchain can improve the industry with smart contracts, smart invoicing, pricing clarity, validation, etc.

It can also increase efficiency, making business processes quicker and smarter, leading to adoption and enabling and improving sustainability. By automating smart contracts on a secure and immutable blockchain, entities along a supply chain can be incentivized to contribute to sustainability goals.

There’s no time for delay. One can already buy credits today from a farmer’s field in Saskatchewan or the rainforest in Brazil, and blockchain will promote the overall stability of the system while providing a protocol that is accessible and testable. Blockchain can standardize global markets and create a transparent and immutable system of carbon credits.

"Op-ed: Consensus algorithms can be engineered to unlock blockchain for business","Connecting traditional businesses with blockchain technology requires merging the pBFT consensus algorithm and asynchronous model to ensure compliance, data privacy, and scalable enterprise solutions.","The following is a guest post by Venom Foundation CTO Christopher Louis Tsu.

Connecting blockchain to traditional businesses is not a simple process. So-called non-crypto industries, particularly finance, banking and insurance, are markedly disconnected because each possesses a general modus operandi that does not neatly fit into current blockchain solutions.

Concerns in these fields abound over security, compliance and cloud computing and how this fits into implementing on-chain technology. Here are two disjointed worlds, which can be brought together through fintech and blockchain innovations. But this is not a straightforward process.

The truth is it’s hard to create a layer one solution, a blockchain, which adheres to the principles of decentralization and transparency without sacrificing the important aspects of data privacy and regulatory compliance.

Those working to build the blockchain-based future need to pay close attention to these latter features. In the absence of proper data protocols, traditional finance executives are unlikely to adopt the technology — nor will the tangentially related banking and insurance industries — while careful consideration must be taken to avoid the ire of lawmakers.

The tempting solution for hungry innovators is to abandon fundamental crypto principles. In the process, they would lose sight of what makes the technology so robust and inherently scalable. But it does not have to be this way.

Overcoming the Challenges

Moderating the hype around blockchain is important to create sustainable, versatile and pertinent solutions to the non-crypto industries which can actually be improved with the technology. Not all sectors need blockchain; this article mentions finance and banking as potential leaders of adoption, because these are examples where applications make a lot of sense.

Increased security and efficiency is a compelling case for the finance sector with the added benefit of more transparent governance, a lower risk of fraud, and reduction of counterparty risk. Insurance companies will look at smart contracts in order to streamline claims processes and enjoy stronger security. Meanwhile, clearance and settlement can be much cheaper and faster using distributed ledgers. Evidently tremendous amounts of money can be saved by large companies handling enormous volumes of capital flow.

As always, implementation presents challenges to innovators. But we can ascertain the major prerequisites for an adoptable blockchain network: it needs to offer complete data privacy and be compliant with legislation that hasn’t even been written and relevant existing legal structures. Businesses will only work with an unfailingly compliant solution and not a single major, public blockchain currently meets these standards. However, adroit engineering of new solutions promises much.

The key lies in iterative advances in technology as witnessed over the past two decades. A blockchain can work in enterprise without compromise, but it needs to be configured in a novel way.

The choice of consensus algorithm carries, of course, vital importance. Yet the steps taken to implement this into a blockchain and how the system is engineered are just as salient. The blockchain trilemma, and the aforementioned prerequisites for an enterprise blockchain, cannot be solved satisfactorily without a shrewdly designed system that makes clever use of multiple technologies.

Consensus is an ever-growing field of research pertaining to blockchain; there is no surprise in technical quarters that hundreds of layer one solutions are being prepared for market, in some cases with wildly different approaches.

One compelling technical solution lies in the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT) consensus algorithm, a sustainability-led shift from Proof of Work. Yet the heavy lifting cannot be done by pBFT alone. If it could, companies would have done so already.

To unlock the immense potential of a blockchain with pBFT one may look towards a technology still heavily used in Web2 which, when integrated properly, provides enormous upside for businesses not yet convinced by existing chains.

Merging Two Evolution Cycles

pBFT proves to be a highly streamlined method for reaching consensus in a distributed environment while maintaining bulletproof robustness, demonstrable in huge ecosystems: examples include the Cosmos Blockchains on Tendermint consensus, Hyperledger and many others. There is no doubt that static and dynamic sharding are among the fastest approaches to consensus in production, which pBFT does.

But what we haven’t seen often is pBFT implemented with an asynchronous model. This is the golden ticket to both satisfying traditional enterprise needs and retaining ironclad crypto security, while leaving the door wide open for decentralized applications.

pBFT has evolved as an energy efficient way of smart contract execution in a trustless decentralized environment, at the same time the asynchronous model has grown to be favored by traditional enterprise architects, such as Kafka and Akka, as an efficient way to parallelize execution in a clustered environment.

Asynchronous stateless communication, as opposed to stateful, is generally used by all traditional clustered databases, all distributed queues and even many app caches. Stateless is far less resource intensive because the system does not need to track session details and multiple links, and the asynchronous model itself ensures transaction throughput can remain high as nodes do not need to wait for other nodes to receive their messages.

In a stateless system, no information needs to be stored nor does it necessitate a response, tracking or the resending of requests in the absence of a response. Consider this protocol as a highly streamlined engine which eliminates bandwidth-hogging processes wherever possible.

Now when we talk of parallelizing execution, we can often take this to mean dynamic and static sharding — it’s the most popular method, especially within a blockchain context. Splitting and storing a dataset across multiplicitous databases and adding more machines allows vast volumes of data to be stored effectively to scale to manage ever-increasing data flows and rapid traffic growth.

A combination of pBFT and the asynchronous model shows a structure’s markings to create a blockchain that does the job rapidly, at scale, and to the high requirements of lawmakers and business leaders.

The Emerging Role of pBFT in Enterprise

pBFT is a consensus algorithm designed in the 1990s to solve problems in many available Byzantine Fault Tolerance solutions. Now it seems tailor-made for blockchain applications in non-crypto businesses, apt for those involving a consortium of enterprise organizations because each organization can represent a node on the network — with each of these nodes programmed to have clusters of instances and load balancers behind the node’s endpoint.

This means computational power can be massively scaled without compromising on a rapid response time. High levels of security are ensured without sacrificing an incredibly cost-effective communication overhead.

With a substantial majority required to confirm transactions, the system is set up to work even in situations where validators crash or maliciously broadcast incorrect information. And the crucial function of nodes here is underlaid by verification. Each network user must verify their identity so such a system passes KYC with flying colors.

pBFT is, in essence, designed to ensure robust data consistency with no danger of data loss in the event several nodes go offline or hardware failure occurs.

Yet data can be protected and kept private without compromising the transparency of transactions to those allowed access; any node without the user’s private key cannot forge its identity or the message’s signature. The system is inherently reliable because the cost of attempting such a forgery is astronomical.

Moreover, pBFT allows a distributed system to reach consensus despite an event where several nodes act to subvert the system. Every node performs computations for verifiability, security, and peace due to the inbuilt usage of cryptographic algorithms such as signature, signature verification, and hash.

The green light from lawmakers is plausible because imminent regulations can be considered, especially regarding the potential for fraud and money laundering. Traditional businesses will meanwhile need their operations to remain compliant without disposing of proper data protection — necessary in the EU with GDPR, but further desirable for many jurisdictions, businesses, and customers — and with no loss of data privacy.

Anti Money Laundering (AML), standard banking transactions, and clearing and settlement, once made possible on a blockchain without drawbacks or legal issues, could lead to a wave of adoption in finance and banking as a much better solution than those being used already.

And in terms of economic logic, a strong case for the asynchronous model here is wrapped in the parallelization aspect. While major blockchains grapple with the issue of scaling to handle high volumes of traffic, here lies an inbuilt sharding protocol that exponentially increases the limit without increasing costs.

A Feasible Path to Adoption

Common logic dictates companies will adopt a blockchain with a reliably high network speed and low transaction fees. Costs do come secondary to necessities regarding compliance and data protection, but it forms a crucial hinge upon which widespread adoption can happen. pBFT combined with an asynchronous model promises low fees, high speed and reliability, and data redundancy if implemented.

Using an asynchronous model bolsters network security as a limited number of nodes can behave unpredictably or arbitrarily without compromising the system’s safety. pBFT tolerates byzantine faults in an asynchronous network and uses the view-change protocol to guarantee liveness — which means the client finally receives the correct replies to their requests. This works exceptionally well in an asynchronous environment such as the Internet.

With pBFT ensuring a network attack is highly improbable. With the confidence that delays to consensus will not be indefinite, an asynchronous stateless model can create a blockchain that serves both the traditional and crypto worlds.

Enterprise demands are not broadly changing. Therefore, innovators must deliver a blockchain that meets these demands. Achieving this would open the gates to adoption.

"Britain’s fourth largest newspaper offers free King Charles coronation NFTs","The Evening Standard is allowing Nifty Gateway users to mint their own cryptocollectible featuring the famous St. Edwards Crown.","The Evening Standard said on May 5 that it is releasing a series of free non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to commemorate the coronation of King Charles.

NFT features animated St. Edward’s Crown

The collectible NFT includes an animated copy of “The Oath” by Trevor Jones. This painting features St. Edward’s Crown, the centerpiece of the UK’s Crown Jewels.

The non-fungible token is currently available for free on the Nifty Gateway marketplace. Users only need to provide an email address to register and collect the item, though it is unclear whether users need to pay a  transaction fee to receive the item.

The NFT is “open edition,” meaning that there is no limit on the number of NFTs that can be minted. Users have minted 9,200 copies of the NFT as of 11:30 p.m. UTC on May 5.

Though there is no limit on the number of minted NFTs, there is a time limit. Users can only mint the token between Thursday, May 4 and Sunday, May 7.

The event represents a move into crypto from a major UK company. The Evening Standard was the UK’s fourth largest daily paper by circulation in 2020 following The Metro, The Sun, and The Daily Mail. It circulated over 314,000 papers per day in January 2023.

The state of crypto in Britain

The UK government previously announced its desire for the country to become a “crypto hub” in April 2022. This originally included plans for the Royal Mint to issue its own NFT, though those plans were ultimately dropped in March 2023.

The UK has more recently announced plans to create post-Brexit crypto regulation and currently has strict regulations from The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The FCA has  recently cracked down on unregistered crypto ATMs and non-compliant advertising, and the agency has even targeted specific crypto companies such as Binance.

Statista suggests that the UK crypto industry could see $1.89 billion in revenue in 2023.

"Google could lose the AI race, leaked doc says","A Google engineer suggested that his company should work with the open-source community — something that it has done with browsers, Android, and crypto.","A senior Google engineer said that both OpenAI and his own company could lose AI development race, as seen in an internal document leaked on May 4.

Google, OpenAI could lose against open-source

Google has discussed its AI plans in an earnings call and has publicly begun to offer a chatbot called Bard. However, the firm has countless other AI research efforts underway internally, and now, an engineer has suggested that those efforts may not be enough.

The anonymous Google engineer wrote:

“The uncomfortable truth is … we aren’t positioned to win this arms race and neither is OpenAI. While we’ve been squabbling, a third faction has been quietly eating our lunch.”

That third faction, the anonymous engineer said, is the open-source community, which is currently “lapping” Google and is open to anyone with a “beefy laptop.”

The engineer said that the open-source community has already solved problems that Google and other closed developers struggle with. He cited Meta’s LLaMA as the open-source community’s first “really capable foundation model.” Despite its infancy, the community began to improve upon LLaMA within days of its leak on March 3.

The engineer also commented on Google’s competition with ChatGPT creator OpenAI. He argued that although OpenAI has recruited researchers from Google, it faces the same challenges that Google does and will eventually be “eclipsed” by open source.

Google should work with open-source

The engineer suggested that competing directly with open source is a “losing proposition,” noting that users will not pay for restricted models when free and unrestricted models exist.

As such, he said that Google should cooperate with the open-source community. He noted that Google has already done this with other open-source products, such as its Chrome web browser and its mobile operating system, Android.

Google’s cloud division has also worked extensively with numerous open-source blockchain projects — including Polygon, Solana, and Tezos, among others.

"Binance probed by DOJ over potential Russian sanctions violations","The company and its executive have not been charged with wrongdoing.","The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is looking into possible violations of Russian sanctions by Binance, Bloomberg reported May 5.

Specifically, the DOJ’s national security division intends to determine whether Binance or its executives circumvented sanctions around Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Numerous sanctions of this type were imposed beginning in early 2022, and Binance seemingly responded by limiting its services to Russia in April 2022.

The investigation is being conducted in parallel with another ongoing inquiry from the DOJ’s criminal vision, according to Bloomberg’s sources.

Binance and its executives have not yet been accused of wrongdoing, and the probe has not been officially announced or previously reported, Bloomberg said. Instead, it obtained its information from five individuals with knowledge of the matter.

Bloomberg’s sources said that Binance has previously engaged with the DOJ to resolve other issues around compliance, particularly those concerning Iranian sanctions evasion.

Incidentally, Senator Elizabeth Warren addressed Binance’s role in handling cryptocurrency from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on May 4.

Elsewhere, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed charges against Binance on March 27, alleging Binance allowed users to illegally access commodities.

"Elizabeth Warren calls crypto ‘method of choice’ for sanction evasion","Senator Warren drew attention to illicit activity by Russia, North Korea, and Iran.","Senator Elizabeth Warren testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee on May 4, where she emphasized crypto’s use in crime and sanctions evasion.

Russia, North Korea’s crypto use in 2022

During her testimony, Warren said:

“Cryptocurrency is now the method of choice for countries to evade sanctions so that they can fund weapons programs support spying and promote cyber attacks.”

Warren explained that although much cryptocurrency-related crime is “hidden,” more than $20 billion in illicit transactions took place over the course of 2022, an estimate that is in line with recent data from Chainalysis. Warren further noted that Russia and North Korea moved at least $8 billion through cryptocurrency.

She added that, according to the UN Security Council, North Korea uses stolen crypto to fund nuclear weapons programs. Lieutenant General Scott D. Berrier acknowledged that this “is a threat that we recognize” when Warren asked him if this was so.

Warren also asked Avril D. Haines, Director of National Intelligence, if crypto poses such a threat. Haines responded by stating that cryptocurrency does not just contribute to North Korea’s weapons development but also threatens network security.

Warren highlights Islamic groups, Russian ransomware

Warren also said Binance handled $8 billion of Iranian crypto transactions since 2018. She said those transactions include a portion of crypto earned by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which operates the country’s largest Bitcoin mining operation.

Finally, Warren said that leading ransomware groups are believed to be operated by Russian actors and added that virtually 100% of ransomware payments are conducted in payment, based on data from a past Homeland Security report.

Haines and Berrier once again answered that those activities constitute a threat.

Warren concluded that she and Senator Roger Marshall plan to reintroduce a bill to increase regulation of crypto-created crime. She said that this bill is different from securities regulations that aim to protect investors from fraud.

Warren has long been a harsh critic of cryptocurrency. In late March, she said that her re-election campaign would involve “build[ing] an anti-crypto army.” She previously attempted to advance a crypto regulation bill in December 2022.

"Lawmakers throw weight behind New York’s CRPTO act","The CRPTO act requires crypto firms to refund customers defrauded on their platform and forces crypto companies to undergo auditing.","Several New York lawmakers have thrown their weight behind New York’s new Crypto Regulation, Protection, Transparency, and Oversight (CRPTO) Act.

On May 5, New York Attorney General Letitia James revealed a proposed bill that would further extend the scope of regulatory authority over crypto firms.

What is the CRPTO Act?

According to James, the  landmark legislation will “tighten regulations on crypto industry to protect investors, consumers, and the broader economy.”

The regulatory chief tweeted that her office proposes common-sense measures to end fraud and dysfunction in the crypto space.

She noted that fraud in the cryptocurrency industry has led to the loss of billions for investors, with the greater impact felt by low-income investors and people of color.

“Banks and other financial services are regulated. The cryptocurrency industry must be too,” she said.

The proposed legislation requires crypto firms to refund customers defrauded on their platform and forces crypto companies to undergo public and independent auditing.

Additionally, the bill will prevent crypto firms from lending and borrowing users’ assets, give investors all information about risk and conflict of interest about crypto companies, and prevent the owners of crypto platforms from also creating crypto tokens.

Another key feature of the bill is that it would extend the powers of the office of the Attorney General to shut down companies that violate the proposed laws. The New York State Department of Financial Services will also get additional powers to regulate digital assets.

Under James, New York’s Office of the Attorney General has filed several enforcement actions against crypto firms like KuCoin and individuals like the founder of bankrupt Celsius, Alex Mashinsky.

Lawmakers throw weight behind the bill

Meanwhile, the bill has already received support from several state senators and assembly members.

The Deputy Majority leader of the New York assembly Michaelle Solages said:

“With communities of color increasingly drawn to investing in crypto, it’s essential that we introduce common-sense protections to prevent them from facing higher financial risks.”

State Senator Cordell Cleare commended New York’s Attorney General for the bill. Cleare added:

“All financial products and instruments must be honest, transparent, and failsafe — this goes double for emerging industries.”

New York lawmakers might be open to passing the bill, considering the same legislature passed a 2-year moratorium on Bitcoin (BTC) mining activities within the state.

Meanwhile, some believe the lawmakers might not pass the bill. A K&L Gates law firm partner, Andrew Hinkes, said the bill will fail “because it relies on certain assumptions about crypto that are simply not true.”

"Binance listing pushes Floki, Pepe up more than 50%","Binance warned that Pepe insiders bought 7% of its total supply, adding that it has no token utility or value support mechanism.","Crypto exchange Binance has revealed it would list Pepe (PEPE) and Floki Inu (FLOKI) in its innovation zone, according to a May 5 statement.

The crypto exchange said its users would enjoy zero maker fees on the spot trading of the memecoins True USD (TUSD) pairing.

Besides that, the tokens would be listed as a borrowable asset within the next 48 hours.

Meanwhile, Binance warned its users that memecoins are extremely risky assets to trade — adding that Pepe has no token utility or value support mechanism.

Binance also highlighted that the token insiders bought around 7% of its total supply immediately after its launch.

Binance wrote:

“FLOKI and PEPE are relatively new tokens that pose a higher than normal risk, and as such will likely be subject to high price volatility.”

Following the news, the two memecoins rallied by more than 50%, respectively, according to CryptoSlate data.

Floki’s value jumped to as high as $0.00005, while Pepe pumped to $0.0000029.

"WSB rallies over 200% after suspect offers refund option","The stolen WSB funds were refunded to a multi-sig wallet controlled by WSBMod and two crypto influencers, ZachXBT and Loopify.","WSB Coin, the official memecoin for Wall Street Bets subreddit, has seen its value surge by over 200% in the last 24 hours after the team member behind the rug pull offered a refund option.

Zjz.eth said he was looking for a refund mechanism that would enable him to return the stolen funds. This would be claimable by those who bought the token before the May 4 dump. He urged any developer who could create a contract to contact him.

Zjz.eth added that the original deployer WSBMod was secretly draining funds using the huge airdrops he claimed and sold many of the tokens. According to him, this is why WSBMod was willing to set up the pool for free and claimed no allocation for himself.

The revelation adds to the many controversies surrounding the WSB coin after Zjz.eth and other members who had control of the multi-sig initially rug pulled the memecoin and sold the tokens for 334 ETH — roughly $640,000.

Funds returned to multsig controlled by ZachXBT, others

Meanwhile, WSBMod denied Zjz.ETH’s allegations, saying the addresses eligible for the airdrop did not belong to him and that he had not benefited from the token.

All the funds were later sent back to a multi-sig controlled by WSBMod and two crypto influencers, ZachXBT and Loopify.

After the refund, the community voted to buy back all the WSB using the remaining ETH in the recovery — causing the value to rebound.

Due to this, the WSB coin shot to as high as $0.0003411 before rebounding to its current levels of $0.00022010. Its trading volume also exceeded $40 million during the last 24 hours, according to Coingecko data.

Meanwhile, WSBMod further announced that the memecoin would assemble a new team that would include a former Wall Street Bets moderator and a community manager, Aurelian. WSBMod added that there would be no changes to the multi-sig.

WSBMod said the team would be working pro bono, and the community will vote on any future compensation to team members.

"UK’s FCA takes action against illegal crypto ATM operators","The UK FCA said no crypto ATM operator was registered with it, making their operations illegal in the country.","The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is cracking down on illegal crypto ATMs in the country, stating that they pose a money laundering threat.

According to a May 5 statement, the regulator worked with regional police to inspect Exeter, Sheffield, and Nottingham sites. While Crypto ATMs are legal, they must be registered with the authority before operating.

The financial regulator added that no crypto ATM operator was registered with it, making their operations illegal in the country,

FCA’s Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight, Therese Chambers, said:

“Crypto ATMs operating without FCA registration are illegal. We will act to stop illegal activity… Besides disrupting unregistered crypto businesses, the joint efforts have helped raise awareness of illegally operated crypto ATMs in the UK among the public. This is especially important as crypto products are high risk and not currently regulated.”

Meanwhile, the Economic Crime Unit Manager at the South West Regional Organised Crime Unit, Peter Highway, highlighted the danger of the illegal operations of the crypto ATMs. Highway said:

“Criminals will use crypto ATMs to launder illegally obtained cash, so we were pleased to assist our colleagues at the FCA in targeting businesses in the region displaying these machines without authorization.”

According to the FCA, it is reviewing evidence gathered from the inspection. The regulator did not provide further information on its next line of action.

Crypto ATMs operation in the U.K.

Despite their lack of authorization to operate in the country, Coin ATM Radar reports that there are currently 17 crypto ATMs in the country — located in Birmingham, London, and Manchester.

Meanwhile, this represents a steep decline from its numbers as of March 2022. At the time, there were around 81 Bitcoin (BTC) ATMs/Tellers in different locations in the country.

The ATMs have steadily declined as the FCA began enforcing actions against illegal crypto ATM operators.

The project deleted its Twitter account, and the scammer already transferred over 68 Ethereum (ETH), according to PeckShieldAlert’s tweet.

The rug pull

Avid crypto collector @borovik.eth was one of the first ones to realize the pull. He tweeted a screenshot of Yoda Coin’s official account, which was inaccessible.

Crypto Twitter then provided additional information about the suspended addresses in the comments. On-chain sleuth ZachXBT shared that the YodaCoin team also deactivated nine bot accounts with gold checkmarks.

PeckShieldAlert monitored the scammers’ wallet movements and discovered that they moved over 68 ETH to the FixedFloat exchange. The amount equates to over $129,000 in ETH at the time of writing.

Memecoin season

Even though the crypto community’s thoughts on memecoins may vary, recent data revealed that they are, in fact, quite resilient. A CryptoSlate insight from April stated that memecoins:

“Continue to defy expectations by thriving in the bear market, outperforming other cryptocurrencies and expanding their utility, attracting retail investors and newcomers to the crypto world.”

Popular memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have proven themselves to be quite profitable in the past. While their volatility has become mainstream, other memecoins have been surprising investors lately.

Most recently, memecoin PEPE (PEPE) attracted the eyes of the crypto community when it soared over 90% within 24 hours on May 1. At the time of writing, PEPE continues its surge. The token recorded a 59.38% increase in the last 24 hours and a nearly 700% increase over the previous seven days.

According to CryptoSlate data, the memecoin market has 1.49% sector dominance with over a $17 billion market cap. The sector’s 24-hour volume sits at over $1.49 billion.

"Pepe climbs to new ATH as market cap approaches $1B","On-chain analyst Lookonchain reported how a whale exchanged almost all of its assets for PEPE and made a profit of $1.23 million.","Ethereum-based Pepe memecoin rallied to a new all-time high of $0.000002322 earlier today after increasing by more than 50% in the last 24 hours, according to CryptoSlate data.

During this period, the market cap of the memecoin touched as high as $931 million before retracing to its current level of $864.54 million, according to Coingecko data.

Pepe market cap surpasses Terra Classic, others

The memecoin is ranked as the 61st largest crypto asset by market cap — above several significant crypto assets like Terra Classic (LUNC), Optimism (OP), Huobi Token (HT), BitTorrent (BTT), MakerDAO (MKR), USDD, and others.

Pepe’s market cap meteoric rise has prompted speculations that it could soon reach $1 billion.

Although its market cap is still below that of memecoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, its trading volume in the last 24 hours has surpassed theirs. According to Coingecko data, Pepe’s 24-hour trading volume stood at $647 million as of press time, while that of DOGE stood at $323 million and SHIB $109 million.

Pepe still printing millionaires

CryptoSlate reported that the memecoin had printed several millionaires as early buyers have been profiting from the asset.

On-chain analyst Lookonchain reported how a whale exchanged almost all of its assets for the memecoin and made a profit of $1.23 million.

Meanwhile, the massive hype and strong community support have been the primary reason for its performance, coupled with the existing popularity of the Pepe frog meme — which the creators are also capitalizing on.

Several exchanges like ByBit, BitMEX, OKX, and MEXC. have listed PEPE and its perpetual contracts.

However, major exchanges like Binance have yet to list it. In a recent AMA session, Binance CEO Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao said the exchange could list the token if it continues to trend and sees increased demand.

According to Kennedy, currency digitization has already given the government unprecedented powers to surveil and control economic life. He believes CBDCs would further “magnify the government’s power to suffocate dissent by cutting off access to funds with a keystroke.”

The presidential candidate’s rhetoric against CBDCs is unsurprising, considering he once described them as a tool for “financial slavery and political tyranny.”

Meanwhile, Kennedy said Bitcoin allows people to conduct transactions without government interference. He further described the flagship digital asset as a “lifesaver for people’s movements around the world.”

Governments financially censor their political enemies

Without CBDCs, Kennedy highlighted how governments have financially censored their political enemies. He said this tends to play out under authoritarian regimes, but Western countries like Canada have also adopted this approach.

Kennedy cited examples of how the Canadian government froze the bank accounts of over 200 individuals because of their protests against the vaccine mandate.

According to Kennedy, this event showed that the U.S. could someday freeze an individual’s bank account because of their political views and comments on social media.

“After all, in 2010, Paypal, Visa, and Mastercard suspended WikiLeaks, at the behest of the US State Department,” he added.

Rising anti-CBDC stand

Meanwhile, a growing list of U.S. politicians has taken a stand against CBDCs, citing the risk of financial censorship.

Several U.S. states like Florida, North Dakota, and North Carolina have introduced bills to ban the national digital currency. Senator Ted Cruz also introduced a bill to ban the Federal Reserves from issuing this currency.

While several crypto community members have lauded this ban, some stakeholders have warned that the anti-CBDC moves could hurt Bitcoin. The Bitcoin Policy Institute wrote that South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem’s decision to veto a CBDC bill affected BTC.

According to the Institute, the bill contained provisions that expanded the definitions and protections for Bitcoin. Besides that, it also created a legal mechanism that recognizes self-custody and the protocol’s inclusion in traditional lending, insurance, and commercial transactions.

"Israel seized nearly 200 Binance accounts over terrorism links over two years","The seized accounts reportedly are tied to Hamas and Islamic State (ISIS).","Authorities in Israel have seized 190 Binance accounts with ties to Islamic terrorist groups since 2021, Reuters said on May 4.

Reuters reported that two of those accounts were linked to Islamic State (ISIS) and that almost all of the other accounts were owned by three firms with ties to Hamas.

Reuters was unable to determine the total amount of cryptocurrency seized across those 190 accounts. However, it noted that Israel’s National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing (NBCTF) disclosed in April that it had seized cryptocurrency worth more than $137,000 from 80 Binance accounts belonging to the same three firms.

The NBCTF said that those accounts were the property of “terrorist organizations.” However, a representative for one of the companies — Al Mutahadun For Exchange — said that the firm does not use cryptocurrency and only works with fiat money.

Other reports from December suggest that Israel seized at least $33,500 and $750,000 of cryptocurrency from Hamas-linked crypto wallets on other occasions.

Incidentally, U.S. CFTC charges from March suggest that Binance executives knowingly discussed and permitted transactions connected to Hamas.

"Elizabeth Warren calls crypto ‘method of choice’ for sanction evasion","Senator Warren drew attention to illicit activity by Russia, North Korea, and Iran.","Senator Elizabeth Warren testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee on May 4, where she emphasized crypto’s use in crime and sanctions evasion.

Russia, North Korea’s crypto use in 2022

During her testimony, Warren said:

“Cryptocurrency is now the method of choice for countries to evade sanctions so that they can fund weapons programs support spying and promote cyber attacks.”

Warren explained that although much cryptocurrency-related crime is “hidden,” more than $20 billion in illicit transactions took place over the course of 2022, an estimate that is in line with recent data from Chainalysis. Warren further noted that Russia and North Korea moved at least $8 billion through cryptocurrency.

She added that, according to the UN Security Council, North Korea uses stolen crypto to fund nuclear weapons programs. Lieutenant General Scott D. Berrier acknowledged that this “is a threat that we recognize” when Warren asked him if this was so.

Warren also asked Avril D. Haines, Director of National Intelligence, if crypto poses such a threat. Haines responded by stating that cryptocurrency does not just contribute to North Korea’s weapons development but also threatens network security.

Warren highlights Islamic groups, Russian ransomware

Warren also said Binance handled $8 billion of Iranian crypto transactions since 2018. She said those transactions include a portion of crypto earned by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which operates the country’s largest Bitcoin mining operation.

Finally, Warren said that leading ransomware groups are believed to be operated by Russian actors and added that virtually 100% of ransomware payments are conducted in payment, based on data from a past Homeland Security report.

Haines and Berrier once again answered that those activities constitute a threat.

Warren concluded that she and Senator Roger Marshall plan to reintroduce a bill to increase regulation of crypto-created crime. She said that this bill is different from securities regulations that aim to protect investors from fraud.

Warren has long been a harsh critic of cryptocurrency. In late March, she said that her re-election campaign would involve “build[ing] an anti-crypto army.” She previously attempted to advance a crypto regulation bill in December 2022.

"Lawmakers throw weight behind New York’s CRPTO act","The CRPTO act requires crypto firms to refund customers defrauded on their platform and forces crypto companies to undergo auditing.","Several New York lawmakers have thrown their weight behind New York’s new Crypto Regulation, Protection, Transparency, and Oversight (CRPTO) Act.

On May 5, New York Attorney General Letitia James revealed a proposed bill that would further extend the scope of regulatory authority over crypto firms.

What is the CRPTO Act?

According to James, the  landmark legislation will “tighten regulations on crypto industry to protect investors, consumers, and the broader economy.”

The regulatory chief tweeted that her office proposes common-sense measures to end fraud and dysfunction in the crypto space.

She noted that fraud in the cryptocurrency industry has led to the loss of billions for investors, with the greater impact felt by low-income investors and people of color.

“Banks and other financial services are regulated. The cryptocurrency industry must be too,” she said.

The proposed legislation requires crypto firms to refund customers defrauded on their platform and forces crypto companies to undergo public and independent auditing.

Additionally, the bill will prevent crypto firms from lending and borrowing users’ assets, give investors all information about risk and conflict of interest about crypto companies, and prevent the owners of crypto platforms from also creating crypto tokens.

Another key feature of the bill is that it would extend the powers of the office of the Attorney General to shut down companies that violate the proposed laws. The New York State Department of Financial Services will also get additional powers to regulate digital assets.

Under James, New York’s Office of the Attorney General has filed several enforcement actions against crypto firms like KuCoin and individuals like the founder of bankrupt Celsius, Alex Mashinsky.

Lawmakers throw weight behind the bill

Meanwhile, the bill has already received support from several state senators and assembly members.

The Deputy Majority leader of the New York assembly Michaelle Solages said:

“With communities of color increasingly drawn to investing in crypto, it’s essential that we introduce common-sense protections to prevent them from facing higher financial risks.”

State Senator Cordell Cleare commended New York’s Attorney General for the bill. Cleare added:

“All financial products and instruments must be honest, transparent, and failsafe — this goes double for emerging industries.”

New York lawmakers might be open to passing the bill, considering the same legislature passed a 2-year moratorium on Bitcoin (BTC) mining activities within the state.

Meanwhile, some believe the lawmakers might not pass the bill. A K&L Gates law firm partner, Andrew Hinkes, said the bill will fail “because it relies on certain assumptions about crypto that are simply not true.”

"Binance listing pushes Floki, Pepe up more than 50%","Binance warned that Pepe insiders bought 7% of its total supply, adding that it has no token utility or value support mechanism.","Crypto exchange Binance has revealed it would list Pepe (PEPE) and Floki Inu (FLOKI) in its innovation zone, according to a May 5 statement.

The crypto exchange said its users would enjoy zero maker fees on the spot trading of the memecoins True USD (TUSD) pairing.

Besides that, the tokens would be listed as a borrowable asset within the next 48 hours.

Meanwhile, Binance warned its users that memecoins are extremely risky assets to trade — adding that Pepe has no token utility or value support mechanism.

Binance also highlighted that the token insiders bought around 7% of its total supply immediately after its launch.

Binance wrote:

“FLOKI and PEPE are relatively new tokens that pose a higher than normal risk, and as such will likely be subject to high price volatility.”

Following the news, the two memecoins rallied by more than 50%, respectively, according to CryptoSlate data.

Floki’s value jumped to as high as $0.00005, while Pepe pumped to $0.0000029.

"WSB rallies over 200% after suspect offers refund option","The stolen WSB funds were refunded to a multi-sig wallet controlled by WSBMod and two crypto influencers, ZachXBT and Loopify.","WSB Coin, the official memecoin for Wall Street Bets subreddit, has seen its value surge by over 200% in the last 24 hours after the team member behind the rug pull offered a refund option.

Zjz.eth said he was looking for a refund mechanism that would enable him to return the stolen funds. This would be claimable by those who bought the token before the May 4 dump. He urged any developer who could create a contract to contact him.

Zjz.eth added that the original deployer WSBMod was secretly draining funds using the huge airdrops he claimed and sold many of the tokens. According to him, this is why WSBMod was willing to set up the pool for free and claimed no allocation for himself.

The revelation adds to the many controversies surrounding the WSB coin after Zjz.eth and other members who had control of the multi-sig initially rug pulled the memecoin and sold the tokens for 334 ETH — roughly $640,000.

Funds returned to multsig controlled by ZachXBT, others

Meanwhile, WSBMod denied Zjz.ETH’s allegations, saying the addresses eligible for the airdrop did not belong to him and that he had not benefited from the token.

All the funds were later sent back to a multi-sig controlled by WSBMod and two crypto influencers, ZachXBT and Loopify.

After the refund, the community voted to buy back all the WSB using the remaining ETH in the recovery — causing the value to rebound.

Due to this, the WSB coin shot to as high as $0.0003411 before rebounding to its current levels of $0.00022010. Its trading volume also exceeded $40 million during the last 24 hours, according to Coingecko data.

Meanwhile, WSBMod further announced that the memecoin would assemble a new team that would include a former Wall Street Bets moderator and a community manager, Aurelian. WSBMod added that there would be no changes to the multi-sig.

WSBMod said the team would be working pro bono, and the community will vote on any future compensation to team members.

"UK’s FCA takes action against illegal crypto ATM operators","The UK FCA said no crypto ATM operator was registered with it, making their operations illegal in the country.","The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is cracking down on illegal crypto ATMs in the country, stating that they pose a money laundering threat.

According to a May 5 statement, the regulator worked with regional police to inspect Exeter, Sheffield, and Nottingham sites. While Crypto ATMs are legal, they must be registered with the authority before operating.

The financial regulator added that no crypto ATM operator was registered with it, making their operations illegal in the country,

FCA’s Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight, Therese Chambers, said:

“Crypto ATMs operating without FCA registration are illegal. We will act to stop illegal activity… Besides disrupting unregistered crypto businesses, the joint efforts have helped raise awareness of illegally operated crypto ATMs in the UK among the public. This is especially important as crypto products are high risk and not currently regulated.”

Meanwhile, the Economic Crime Unit Manager at the South West Regional Organised Crime Unit, Peter Highway, highlighted the danger of the illegal operations of the crypto ATMs. Highway said:

“Criminals will use crypto ATMs to launder illegally obtained cash, so we were pleased to assist our colleagues at the FCA in targeting businesses in the region displaying these machines without authorization.”

According to the FCA, it is reviewing evidence gathered from the inspection. The regulator did not provide further information on its next line of action.

Crypto ATMs operation in the U.K.

Despite their lack of authorization to operate in the country, Coin ATM Radar reports that there are currently 17 crypto ATMs in the country — located in Birmingham, London, and Manchester.

Meanwhile, this represents a steep decline from its numbers as of March 2022. At the time, there were around 81 Bitcoin (BTC) ATMs/Tellers in different locations in the country.

The ATMs have steadily declined as the FCA began enforcing actions against illegal crypto ATM operators.

"Yoda coin’s sudden collapse: how investors lost over $129K in Ethereum to a rug pull scam","YODA coin deleted all its social accounts while the scammer rugged over 68 Ethereum, according to the PeckShieldAlert tweet report.","YODA coin rug pulled and lost 100% of its value on May 5, as crypto sleuth PeckShieldAlert revealed.

The project deleted its Twitter account, and the scammer already transferred over 68 Ethereum (ETH), according to PeckShieldAlert’s tweet.

The rug pull

Avid crypto collector @borovik.eth was one of the first ones to realize the pull. He tweeted a screenshot of Yoda Coin’s official account, which was inaccessible.

Crypto Twitter then provided additional information about the suspended addresses in the comments. On-chain sleuth ZachXBT shared that the YodaCoin team also deactivated nine bot accounts with gold checkmarks.

PeckShieldAlert monitored the scammers’ wallet movements and discovered that they moved over 68 ETH to the FixedFloat exchange. The amount equates to over $129,000 in ETH at the time of writing.

Memecoin season

Even though the crypto community’s thoughts on memecoins may vary, recent data revealed that they are, in fact, quite resilient. A CryptoSlate insight from April stated that memecoins:

“Continue to defy expectations by thriving in the bear market, outperforming other cryptocurrencies and expanding their utility, attracting retail investors and newcomers to the crypto world.”

Popular memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have proven themselves to be quite profitable in the past. While their volatility has become mainstream, other memecoins have been surprising investors lately.

Most recently, memecoin PEPE (PEPE) attracted the eyes of the crypto community when it soared over 90% within 24 hours on May 1. At the time of writing, PEPE continues its surge. The token recorded a 59.38% increase in the last 24 hours and a nearly 700% increase over the previous seven days.

A few days later, the Turbo memecoin, created by ChatGPT, reached over a $30 million market cap within a week of its launch. Several crypto exchanges have also listed Turbo tokens as a tradable asset.

According to CryptoSlate data, the memecoin market has 1.49% sector dominance with over a $17 billion market cap. The sector’s 24-hour volume sits at over $1.49 billion.

"Pepe climbs to new ATH as market cap approaches $1B","On-chain analyst Lookonchain reported how a whale exchanged almost all of its assets for PEPE and made a profit of $1.23 million.","Ethereum-based Pepe memecoin rallied to a new all-time high of $0.000002322 earlier today after increasing by more than 50% in the last 24 hours, according to CryptoSlate data.

During this period, the market cap of the memecoin touched as high as $931 million before retracing to its current level of $864.54 million, according to Coingecko data.

Pepe market cap surpasses Terra Classic, others

The memecoin is ranked as the 61st largest crypto asset by market cap — above several significant crypto assets like Terra Classic (LUNC), Optimism (OP), Huobi Token (HT), BitTorrent (BTT), MakerDAO (MKR), USDD, and others.

Pepe’s market cap meteoric rise has prompted speculations that it could soon reach $1 billion.

Although its market cap is still below that of memecoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, its trading volume in the last 24 hours has surpassed theirs. According to Coingecko data, Pepe’s 24-hour trading volume stood at $647 million as of press time, while that of DOGE stood at $323 million and SHIB $109 million.

Pepe still printing millionaires

CryptoSlate reported that the memecoin had printed several millionaires as early buyers have been profiting from the asset.

On-chain analyst Lookonchain reported how a whale exchanged almost all of its assets for the memecoin and made a profit of $1.23 million.

Meanwhile, the massive hype and strong community support have been the primary reason for its performance, coupled with the existing popularity of the Pepe frog meme — which the creators are also capitalizing on.

Several exchanges like ByBit, BitMEX, OKX, and MEXC. have listed PEPE and its perpetual contracts.

However, major exchanges like Binance have yet to list it. In a recent AMA session, Binance CEO Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao said the exchange could list the token if it continues to trend and sees increased demand.

"US presidential candidate supports Bitcoin, criticizes CBDCs","There is a growing list of U.S. politicians taking a stand against CBDCs, with many citing risks of financial censorship.","U.S. presidential hopeful Robert Kennedy Jr. has supported Bitcoin (BTC) while speaking against central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in a May 5 Twitter thread.

According to Kennedy, currency digitization has already given the government unprecedented powers to surveil and control economic life. He believes CBDCs would further “magnify the government’s power to suffocate dissent by cutting off access to funds with a keystroke.”

The presidential candidate’s rhetoric against CBDCs is unsurprising, considering he once described them as a tool for “financial slavery and political tyranny.”

Meanwhile, Kennedy said Bitcoin allows people to conduct transactions without government interference. He further described the flagship digital asset as a “lifesaver for people’s movements around the world.”

Governments financially censor their political enemies

Without CBDCs, Kennedy highlighted how governments have financially censored their political enemies. He said this tends to play out under authoritarian regimes, but Western countries like Canada have also adopted this approach.

Kennedy cited examples of how the Canadian government froze the bank accounts of over 200 individuals because of their protests against the vaccine mandate.

According to Kennedy, this event showed that the U.S. could someday freeze an individual’s bank account because of their political views and comments on social media.

“After all, in 2010, Paypal, Visa, and Mastercard suspended WikiLeaks, at the behest of the US State Department,” he added.

Rising anti-CBDC stand

Meanwhile, a growing list of U.S. politicians has taken a stand against CBDCs, citing the risk of financial censorship.

Several U.S. states like Florida, North Dakota, and North Carolina have introduced bills to ban the national digital currency. Senator Ted Cruz also introduced a bill to ban the Federal Reserves from issuing this currency.

While several crypto community members have lauded this ban, some stakeholders have warned that the anti-CBDC moves could hurt Bitcoin. The Bitcoin Policy Institute wrote that South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem’s decision to veto a CBDC bill affected BTC.

According to the Institute, the bill contained provisions that expanded the definitions and protections for Bitcoin. Besides that, it also created a legal mechanism that recognizes self-custody and the protocol’s inclusion in traditional lending, insurance, and commercial transactions.

"Israel seized nearly 200 Binance accounts over terrorism links over two years","The seized accounts reportedly are tied to Hamas and Islamic State (ISIS).","Authorities in Israel have seized 190 Binance accounts with ties to Islamic terrorist groups since 2021, Reuters said on May 4.

Reuters reported that two of those accounts were linked to Islamic State (ISIS) and that almost all of the other accounts were owned by three firms with ties to Hamas.

Reuters was unable to determine the total amount of cryptocurrency seized across those 190 accounts. However, it noted that Israel’s National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing (NBCTF) disclosed in April that it had seized cryptocurrency worth more than $137,000 from 80 Binance accounts belonging to the same three firms.

The NBCTF said that those accounts were the property of “terrorist organizations.” However, a representative for one of the companies — Al Mutahadun For Exchange — said that the firm does not use cryptocurrency and only works with fiat money.

Other reports from December suggest that Israel seized at least $33,500 and $750,000 of cryptocurrency from Hamas-linked crypto wallets on other occasions.

Incidentally, U.S. CFTC charges from March suggest that Binance executives knowingly discussed and permitted transactions connected to Hamas.
